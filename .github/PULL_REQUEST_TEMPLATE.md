## Before you Submit

We have some formatting rules in place to keep things consistent and clean:
  - _Your PR title needs to be formatted as `type(context): message`_
  - _Your branch name needs to be formatted as `type/work-being-done`_

**Valid types are:**
  - feat: _a new feature - this will trigger a minor release_
  - fix: _a fix to an existing feature - this will trigger a patch release_
  - refactor: _refactoring code or UI_
  - build: _focused solely on the build/deployment stages (npm, webpack, ci, etc/)_
  - docs: _documentation updates_
  - test: _updating test suites_
  - chore: _cleanup and automated tasks_
  - project: _**only valid in the branch name**, represents a jumping off point for a project_
