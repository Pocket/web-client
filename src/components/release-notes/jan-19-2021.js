        <p>This update includes a number of notable improvements inspired by feedback from our users.</p>

        <h6>ðŸŽ‰ Whatâ€™s New</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Visualize your tags in a new way with the searchable all tags view, and pin your most important tags to the sidebar for quick access.</li>
          <li>Favorite, Archive, Tag, Delete, and Share buttons have been brought out from the <OverflowMenuIcon /> menu, making them much easier to access in both tile and list layouts.</li>
          <li>The list layout is compact so you can see more items at once, optimal for smaller screens.</li>
          <li>Sharing from Pocket has been overhauled to make it easier to share to your favorite services.</li>
          <li>Easily select batches of items (Shift + click) when bulk editing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Weâ€™ve also made significant changes to our underlying codebase so we can make more rapid improvements in the future.</p>
