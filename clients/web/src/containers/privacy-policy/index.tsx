            If you choose to share any articles, videos, or other content with another person, we
            will ask you to provide a valid email address for that person. We may also ask you to
            provide your username and password for third party websites in order to access the
            articles and information published on such sites. We also collect information if you
            contact us for support or help, submit an application or otherwise communicate with us.
            The information which you supply to us enables us to customize and enhance the services
            we provide to you. In addition, it helps us communicate with you about our news, events,
            promotions and new products.

            If you choose to subscribe to our paid subscription service, our third party payment
            processors will collect and handle your credit card and related payment information.

            In addition to the information that you provide to us when you register for a user
            account, we collect information about the URLs, titles and content of the web pages and
            other information you save to Pocket. The types of information we collect includes your
            browser type, device type, time zone, language, and other information related to the
            manner in which you access the Pocket Technologies. If you are on a mobile device, we
            collect the advertising identifiers provided by Apple on iOS and by Google on Android.
            You can change this identifier in your device settings. We also collect information
            about your use of the Pocket Technologies so that we can provide our services. For
            example, as a part of providing Pocket’s syncing features, we sync information about the
            items that you save and view within Pocket so that your list, tags, scroll position, and
            other account and usage information may be synced across all of your devices.

                engage with our website and product, and to remember your account preferences and
                language settings. For example, we use Google Analytics and other tools to
                understand which Pocket webpages are popular. We also use pixels in our emails in

            your inquiries, to provide customer support and to supply any products or services you
            have requested. In addition, if you choose to use the Pocket Technologies to share

            account information to provide that service, but we will not use that email address for

            We also have a legitimate business interest to operate and improve our services such as

            recommendations available to you at a later time on any device that you use to access
            the Pocket Technologies. We also use non-identifying, aggregated information to analyze
            the manner in which the Pocket Technologies are used, which also allows us to improve
            our services. The aggregated information we use includes the manner in which articles,
            videos, or content has been accessed, saved and shared. We may use aggregated
            information to offer a list of top sites or content, to make recommendations to our

              choose to use the Pocket Technologies to share articles, videos, or other content with

              user, with third parties, including content providers, website operators, advertisers
              and publishers. For example, we may share with a content provider a list of the most
              saved articles to Pocket based on an analysis of aggregated, anonymous user data, but
              we would not share with such content provider any personal information regarding such

            <p>
              If you choose to, you may connect your Pocket account to third-party applications to
              enable additional features like saving from your favorite apps or other unique
              features third-party developers have created. We have set up controls in the Pocket
              application so that you can control the information that is shared with third-party
              providers of products and services. For example, you may be informed that another app
              that you use wants to connect to your Pocket account. In some cases, such apps will
              request access to certain data in your Pocket account, such as your Pocket list or
              your preferred topics, sites and authors (which we have developed based on the content
              you have saved to Pocket), so that they can customize their services. Before such
              access is provided, however, you will be asked to authorize the sharing of any such
              information. Although the Pocket Technologies may be used in conjunction with
              third-party products and services, we are not affiliated with, and have no control
              over, such third parties. Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy
              Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect
              from you and we encourage you to check the privacy policy of each third-party provider
              of products or services that you choose to connect your Pocket account to. If you use
              Pocket to save content from YouTube, that content will be made available to Pocket via
              the YouTube API Services, but will still be hosted by the YouTube site. Your use of
              YouTube content will be subject to the{' '}

              products,services, or features that we provide to you, and we may provide some of your
              personal information directly to these third parties. For example, as discussed above,
              we may use a third party payment processor to process payments for our paid
              subscription service. We may also share limited aggregated data with our advertising
              partners (read more in the “Aggregate data” section above). These parties are subject

              discussed above, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to

            around the world. We also use service providers whose computers may also be in various
            countries. This means that your information might end up on one of those computers in
            another country, and that country may have a different level of data protection
            regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of
            your information. No matter what country your information is in, we comply with
            applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.

          <p>
            We have agreements with third parties and have adopted other security measures in place
            to protect against the loss, misuse and/or unauthorized alteration of the information
            under our control or under the control of our service providers. Your personally
            identifiable information is protected by utilizing both online and offline security
            methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical access to the places
            where your information is stored. Although we use industry standard practices to protect
            your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal
            information or private communications will always remain free from security issues. In
            the event of a security breach involving your personal information, we will make any
            legally required disclosures to you in the most expedient time possible and without
            unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate interests of law enforcement, or any
            measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable
            integrity of the data system.

          <p>
            Identity theft and the practice currently known as &ldquo;phishing&rdquo; are of great
            concern to Pocket. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a
            top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your username, password,
            credit card information or national identification number in an unsolicited e-mail or
            telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade
            Commission’s website.
