      "excerpt": "Pause your doomscrolling and take in something more uplifting: NextDraft newsletter guru Dave Pell revisits the most heartwarming news this year. ",
      "intro": "2021 was supposed to be the perfect do-over year after the unprecedented horrors of 2020—one of them, the ubiquity of the word “unprecedented.” It’s probably too much pressure to put on a single calendar year, especially one that, in America, kicked off with an insurrection and, by October, has seen a higher Covid-19 death toll than 2020. \n\nThrough all the highs and lows, Dave Pell has sent out his daily newsletter, [NextDraft](https://nextdraft.com/), the media- and tech-industry favorite that combs the internet for the best stories to read daily. He’s also written *[Please Scream Inside Your Heart: Breaking News and Nervous Breakdowns in the Year That Wouldn’t End](https://www.amazon.com/Please-Scream-Inside-Your-Heart/dp/0306847396/)*, a new book that manages to catalog the roller coaster of the 2020 newscycle, and explain how our relationship with media got out of hand, all buoyed by his signature pace and humor.\n\nBut if *Please Scream* is all about the worst of 2020, what shall we make of the best of 2021? We’re handing the curatorial reins to Pell, the self-appointed Managing Editor of the Internet, to share his favorite, most heartwarming stories from this year. Consider this some inspiration for what we hope for in 2022.",

He’s been news-obsessed since he was a child and is known to his readers as the Internet’s Managing Editor, since he visits 75 news sites a day and narrows that deluge down to the day’s top ten news items. More importantly, Dave is the author of *[Please Scream Inside Your Heart: Breaking News and Nervous Breakdowns in the Year That Wouldn’t End](https://www.amazon.com/Please-Scream-Inside-Your-Heart/dp/0306847396/)*, a real-time ride through the maddening hell that was the 2020 news cycle—when historic turmoil and media mania stretched American sanity, democracy, and toilet paper. From Norman Lear: “I can’t recall a more engaging read.”",
