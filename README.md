# Web Client

> Reaching for the promise of a healthy internet.

The "web-client" code repository represents the front end code for a unified Pocket user experience that is not siloed into discover vs app. For Pocket to truly "Capture the Magic of the Web" we need to take a holistic approach to what the value of Pocket is.

## Installation

#### Authenticating With Github Package Registry

This package is published to Github Package Registry. GHPR uses the same syntax/API as NPM, using a `package.json` file and the same NPM commands. The first time you interact with GHPR, youâ€™ll have to authenticate with it:

Prepare your username and password
- Your username is your Github username
- For your password, if you have not gone through this process before, you must generate a Personal Access Token through Github.
  - Check for existing:
    - Check your `~/.npmrc` file for an existing access token
  - Create New:
      - In github, go to your avatar in top right corner, select Settings
      - Go to Developer Settings, and click Personal Access Token
      - Create new token, checking the "repo", "read:packages" and "write:packages" scopes
- When prompted for password, paste in the copied token

Login
- Open a terminal and enter `npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/`
- Enter your username and password

## Structures

#### Folders
The site content is represented by five primary folders under the `/src` directory

`/pages`

 This is a NEXTjs convention that provides automatic routing.  Each page of the site will be represented here.  There should be a folder representing the page which contains an `index.js` file as a top level and additional files representing any _page specific_ components or layouts

`/common`

This will contain _site specific_ contstants and utilities.  No visual components should be placed here.

`/components`

This should contain _site specific_, components.

`/connectors`

This should contain _site specific_, shared state

`/containers`

These are where _page level_ containers will live along with co-located state files

#### Conventions

The `/containers` folder contains a `layouts` folder. The components in this folder are meant to be wrappers, that every page should leverage.  They provide a space to provide site wide functionality.  By default they have the following:

- Ability to set title (optional - defaults to `Pocket`)
- Nav
- Header
- Footer

## Server
We are using standard nextJS to handle servers side building/rendering/caching.

#### Pages
When serving a page, it should live in the `pages` directory. If you have no special requirements, _**nextJS will automatically serve it**_.

We prefer `getStaticProps` props over `getServerProps` to help with caching and reducing server load. You can read up on the nuances here: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching

```javascript
import MyContainer from 'containers/my-container/my-container'

// This makes this a build time static page.
export async function getStaticProps() {
  return { props: { namespacesRequired: ['common'], subset: 'unread' } }
}

export default MyContainer

```

## Local Development

#### Local Installation

Clone this repo locally. Then simply:

```bash
cd web-client
npm install
```

#### Running Locally

To run the `web-client` site locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will need to update your hosts file to point localhost (127.0.0.1) to the hostname `localhost.web-client.getpocket.com`. Some of our third party API keys are only enabled for `getpocket.com`, and so will not work at `localhost`. See: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/

The discover pages will be deployed locally on `localhost.web-client.getpocket.com`.

### Storybook

This app also has an instance of Storybook, for developing components that will be shared inside of this repo.

To run Storybook (launches window at `localhost.web-client.getpocket.com` with a random port):

```bash
npm run storybook
```

### Testing

#### Unit Tests

For unit testing, we use `mocha` and `assert` with Enzyme's shallow rendering. The primary goal with our unit tests is to flex an isolated chunk of code (e.g. a function, component, or class), and ensure that it satisfies all requirements - verify expected output, given possible inputs. It also serves as documentation for expected behavior of that unit.

Unit test files are co-located alongside our JS files, named as `*.spec.js`. Any file ending in `.spec.js` in the `src` folder will get picked up by mocha and included in tests.

Unit tests can be run locally and are also run via CI as a requirement for PR merging. To run unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To see "verbose" output, meaning the name and status of every test that is run:

```bash
npm run test-verbose
```

To see test results for only a particular spec file (where "MyComponent" is the `describe()` statement for the spec file):
```bash
npm run test -- --grep "MyComponent"
```

##### Test Users

Tests that verify the logged-in user experience will require user auth. Since we don't want to store passwords in Git, the password for test user accounts will need to be set/stored on your own machine. Test users should all use the same password, and be created using the `frontend-test@getpocket.com` alias and "plus sign" gmail syntax, e.g. `frontend-test+fran@getpocket.com`. The password should be set within your `.bash_profile` file like:

```bash
export CYPRESS_POCKET_TEST_USER_SECRET="get the password from a fellow dev"
```

This will make a Cypress environment variable available as `POCKET_TEST_USER_SECRET` that can be used for login credentials. Usernames are stored in the Cypress support folder.

*NOTE: We cannot currently log test users in programmatically, and so test user login is currently incomplete*

## Deployment

#### Feature Branches
Each branch will have a subsequent feature branch that will deployed.
> _Details to follow_

#### Production Release
Production release will happen automatically when a PR is merged to `master`.  Master is a protected branch and can only be modified with an approved PR.
> _Details to follow_

## Contributing

#### Next.js

The `web-client` repo is set up to use [NEXT.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/) for development and deployment.

#### Pocket Web UI

For shared components and consistent styling we leverage `web-ui` of Pocket.  This provides us with global styles, resets, icons, design tokens, typography, colors, and shared components.  To avoid duplication, all components that will be shared across multiple properties will be pulled in from there: [web-ui](https://github.com/Pocket/web-ui)

#### PrettierJS

This project uses PrettierJS to help keep code formatting consistent. It's recommended that you set up your IDE to support Prettier. Read more here: https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html
