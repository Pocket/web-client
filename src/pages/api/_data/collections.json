      "description": "Hank Aaron, one of the greatest baseball players of all time, died in January at age 86. The Atlanta Braves slugger known as Hammerin’ Hank smashed Babe Ruth’s home run record in 1974 by hitting his 715th career homer on his way to 755. But Aaron, who started his career in the segregated Negro Leagues, paid a bitter price for dethroning the white home run king, facing racist threats and abuse every step of the way. “If I was white, all America would be proud of me,” Aaron once said as he was closing in on Ruth. “But I am Black.”",

      "description": "On February 2nd, winter-weary citizens in the United States and Canada turn toward an unlikely prophet for succor: <i>Marmota monax</i>, commonly known as the woodchuck or groundhog. Tradition holds that if the groundhog emerges from its den and sees its own shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter. No shadow means an early spring. <br /><br />Why exactly is there a holiday centered around the prognosticating powers of an oversized ground squirrel? Read on to explore the origins and history of Groundhog Day, including how it relates to actual groundhog biology. But if you’re more interested in the classic 1993 Bill Murray film <i>Groundhog Day</i>, well, we’ve got you covered there, too. <br />",

I don’t have subscriptions to all different cooking outlets, nor do I have enough time in the day to read through all of them honestly. The ones I do find and I can’t wait to make, I save to my <a data-highlightable=\"1\" href=\"https://bit.ly/3oFpemZ\" class=\"link\">Pocket</a> app. With a simple click, I can save them and read them back whenever I want. It’s also an incredibly helpful tool for keeping track of my own recipes. These are some of my favorites for the holidays.<br data-highlightable=\"1\" />",

      "description": "American democracy is a lot younger than it looks. Just 100 years ago, on August 18, 1920, the 19th Amendment was ratified, enshrining women’s right to vote in the U.S. Constitution. While women’s suffrage was hard won, the battle for the ballot would continue for decades, especially for Black and Indigenous women. This collection explores the history and impact of that century-old victory, and the complicated legacy that still informs today.",

What began with industry outcry over the on-camera arrest of a Black CNN reporter in Minneapolis (while his white colleague also worked nearby, untouched) escalated on Twitter to Black and other journalists of color exposing workplace frustrations over racism, representation and “objectivity” that affect <em>how</em> U.S. newsrooms cover the police killings of unarmed Black men and women. Top editors stepped down. Journalists resigned. Advertisers balked. Some outlets promised change—and still the airing of dirty laundry continues apace on Twitter. This is unprecedented, says long-time social justice journalist&nbsp;<strong><strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://seemurphy.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">Carla Murphy</a></strong>.&nbsp;</strong>To help understand the roots and ramifications of this public revolt, she has curated a reading list about how this latest reckoning on race is disrupting the nation’s newsrooms.",

Just 100 years ago, on August 18, 1920, the 19th Amendment was ratified, enshrining women’s right to vote in the U.S. Constitution. While women’s suffrage was hard won, the battle for the ballot would continue for decades, especially for Black and Indigenous women. This collection explores the history and impact of that century-old victory, and the complicated legacy that still informs today.",
