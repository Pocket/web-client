For a penny, visitors could not only see this modern marvel up close, but they also had the <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/621109/brief-history-ladies-bathroom" target="_blank" nodecheckid="3dd9df9e-8a93-f40e-2fef-5e994bca2652" data-is-check-this-processed="true">opportunity to test it out</a>, pulling chains that demonstrated how the new technology worked. It was a mahogany-seated flushing toilet in a women’s restroom.</p>

Millions of people visited the Crystal Palace during the months it was open, and the organizers knew that people would be coming for the entire day and would need a place to relieve themselves. And for women, this included a parlor attached to a room of toilet stalls.</p>

If you’ve ever come across one, you may have wondered how it got there and why people thought they needed what were essentially public living rooms directly adjacent to bathrooms. As it turns out, it’s a curious combination of Victorian culture, class and race divisions, retail marketing, and what men thought women needed when they ventured out in public (hint: it’s a couch).</p>
  <h3 data-reactroot="" class="body title">Separate Spheres<br></h3>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">
    <source srcset="https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2018/11/ohio_theatre_columbus_restroom/940.jpg?mod=1543594014" media="(min-width: 1024px)">It was rooted in the idea of separate spheres: that women’s place was in the home and men’s was outside, in public. So when middle-class women did venture into public for extended periods—when they went to the theater, for example—it was thought that they required a private, safe, gender-segregated space of their own that looked and functioned like part of their home. “They were designed like living rooms—like parlors—as spaces to protect virtue,” Wood said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">
    <source srcset="https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2018/11/ohio_theatre_columbus_restroom/940.jpg?mod=1543594014" media="(min-width: 1024px)">But at first, these lounges for women did not include a toilet component, says Terry Kogan, a law professor at the University of Utah. Kogan has worked on guidelines for gender-neutral bathrooms and is an expert on the legal and cultural norms that mandate the segregation of public restrooms by sex.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">

In other words, gender separation and protecting women’s virtue was initially the justification for these spaces, and the toilet came later.</p>

  <p dir="ltr" class="body">“The challenge to Rogers was in, part, that he had to make this building sort of supportive of commerce, which was developing in Boston,” Kogan said. “On the other hand, he was caught in the shadow of the separate-spheres ideology, and what he decided [to do] within the Tremont House was to create spaces that were sex-segregated.” Rogers created rooms exclusively for men and for women, including separate parlors and a library and a billiard room for men.</p>

  </div>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">“The significance of that, in my view, cannot be overstated,” said Kogan. “Rogers and the investors … were basically tipping their hats to the separate-spheres ideology, while creating spaces in the public realm for women to become active consumers in the 19th-century economy.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">The Tremont House was also the first major building in America to have indoor plumbing, with a bank of eight water closets on the main-floor hallway, each designed for a single user. Rogers felt no need to designate them by gender, because like the outhouses they were based on, they were single-user only.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">Plumbing and sewage technology didn’t enable toilets to move indoors in greater numbers until roughly the 1850s, and at that point, some architects decided that water closets should follow the lead of the gender-designated parlors. So they placed single-user water closets in the spaces that were set aside for women. In public libraries, for instance, they would put a single-user water closet off the women’s reading room. “That is, by default, a sex-designated toilet, even though it’s single-user, because only women go into that space,” Kogan noted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">By the 1860 and 1870s, plumbing technology had advanced to the point of facilitating multi-user restrooms. Then, when luxury buildings like hotels, theaters, and department stores added multi-user, gender-segregated restrooms, architects continued the separate-spheres pattern, creating public spaces that imitated the home. It’s at this point that we start seeing women’s restroom lounges emerge.</p>
  <h4 dir="ltr" class="body title">Comfort Stations and Emergency Rooms</h4>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">These rooms typically featured couches where women—perceived to be more fragile—could rest and regroup. Most men’s restrooms from this era did not have an equivalent space. Some did have adjacent rooms, but these were more about socializing than providing somewhere to rest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">In addition to hotels and theaters, department stores were early adopters of public restrooms and ladies’ lounges, primarily because the stores were designed to be daylong experiences, where women would spend hours shopping, getting their hair done at the on-site salon, eating at the restaurant, and resting when they needed a break.</p>

Today, you can still find seating areas adjacent to the women’s restroom in many Nordstrom stores across the country, as well as at Bloomingdale’s and the St. Regis Hotel in New York City.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">As Laura Walikainen Rouleau, a historian and author of the forthcoming book <em>Private Spaces in Public Places</em>, explains, increasing the availability of public restrooms in the late 19th and early 20th century was the goal of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1286790/?page=1" target="_blank" nodecheckid="5c946b3e-fd12-e0c5-4f4e-36f79fb057c6" data-is-check-this-processed="true">“public comfort”</a> movement. Public restrooms were often referred to as comfort stations.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">In the 20th century, with more women entering the workforce during World Wars I and II, the rationale behind the lounges and the function shifted somewhat. Women were now in public more, but they still might want somewhere to relax, take a smoking break, or put on makeup—which was now mainstream after being <a href="https://www.si.edu/spotlight/health-hygiene-and-beauty/make-up" target="_blank" nodecheckid="3f7b7ad0-8550-1f59-069d-bcf3187fc95e" data-is-check-this-processed="true">stigmatized</a>. It was not acceptable, however, for women to apply makeup in public. Lounges were outfitted with vanities and other mirrors so that women would have a place to touch up their cosmetics in semi-privacy.</p>

    <p class="description"><span class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><i>American servicewomen chat and apply makeup in the powder room of a women’s military-services club in New York during World War II. PHoto by Bob Wands/AP</i>.</span><span class="caption-space"></span></span></p>
  </div>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">Depending on who you ask, you’ll hear different terms used for a room with couches next to a room with toilets. As is the case today, there was no universal name for where people used the toilet in a public setting, or any adjoining rooms. Walikainen Rouleau says the seating areas for women were referred to as “retiring rooms,” “rest rooms” (as in a room specifically for resting), and even “emergency rooms.” The last term sounds bizarre today, but the rooms were partly intended as places where women could lie down if they were feeling sick or faint, or even wait for medical assistance to arrive. Of course, euphemisms such as “retiring room” avoided referring to the private physical activities of the women inside—not just going to the bathroom, but breastfeeding and menstruation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">It’s important to note that these lounges or parlors were, for the most part, for upper- or middle-class white women. Walikainen Rouleau says most of the examples she has found of women’s lounges or parlors in public spaces have come from the northern Midwestern parts of the United States. She has also found floor plans for standalone public-comfort stations in Texas, with divisions based on race: sections for white women and for black women; sections for white men and for black men.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">“The white women’s sections are by far the most elaborate,” she said. “This is where the infants’ room with the sink in it is.” The white side of the station also had separate ladies’ and men’s parlors. “There really are not these spaces offered for African-American women.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">“I believe at this time that the middle-class portion of society viewed privacy as dependent on these social constructs … that women and their bodies and their activities needed to somehow be shielded, but especially white middle-class women,” Walikainen Rouleau said.</p>
  <h4 dir="ltr" class="body title">The Future of the Restroom-Plus</h4>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">One of the reasons why restroom lounges are now scarce is because in the older buildings where they could once be found, they are often lost during renovations, converted into other types of space with more utility or potential for profit—such as a bar area in a theater, or more retail space in a department store.</p>
  <div data-index="6" class="body story-image">

  </div>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">That didn’t happen at Baltimore’s iconic Senator Theatre, which reopened in 2013 after $3.5 million in improvements. Renovation architect Alex Castro says that in the early stages of the project, there was talk of whether the restroom lounges should stay, or, like so many others, be turned into more lucrative space. Ultimately, they stayed. “To get rid of them would be to get rid of one of the most important aspects of the theater itself,” Castro said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">When the Senator opened in 1939, even going to your neighborhood theater was an event. Moviegoers weren’t just looking to see the latest film—they wanted a glamorous Hollywood experience. At the Senator, the sophistication that patrons craved was expressed differently in the men’s and women’s restrooms and lounges. The men’s room was dark, with a wood-beam ceiling, a tile floor, and a fireplace. The women’s room, on the other hand, was “glittery and upbeat,” in Castro’s words—a circular, bright, carpeted room, with an area for applying makeup.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">Other theater-restroom lounges that have survived renovations include those at <a href="https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/radio-city-home-of-the-best-restroom/" target="_blank" nodecheckid="7021fab0-c20d-023a-9ab0-197aa2739224" data-is-check-this-processed="true">Radio City Music Hall</a>, the <a href="http://www.bestrestroom.com/us/hall_of_fame/2009/shoji.asp" target="_blank" nodecheckid="d694cba0-7e05-c7fe-1610-d1038a3b9882" data-is-check-this-processed="true">Shoji Tabuchi Theatre</a> in Branson, Missouri, and the <a href="https://la.curbed.com/2013/2/14/10273354/touring-broadways-last-great-movie-palace-the-los-angeles" target="_blank" nodecheckid="8ec22027-9f49-4c2a-2478-d09dd82e4130" data-is-check-this-processed="true">Los Angeles Theater</a>, a gilded movie palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">Although most new buildings don’t have dedicated lounge areas next to restrooms, some have “family rooms” that accommodate people who need to change a child’s diapers or breastfeed. Unlike their predecessors, these rooms tend to be nongendered, reflecting the shift toward a more inclusive concept of parenting. New initiatives like <a href="https://www.stalled.online/" target="_blank" nodecheckid="01402b23-c3d7-4d71-f2cd-3271870fa9b5" data-is-check-this-processed="true">Stalled</a> aim to pave the way for all-gender multi-user restrooms across America.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="body">But the women’s-only lounge isn’t extinct just yet. The trendy Millennial women’s club The Wing has a “Personal Space” zone that includes a changing room, a nursing room, and a beauty room featuring a row of vanities and plush velvet chairs that wouldn’t look out of place in an Art Deco theater. The idea is no longer for women to hide out from the stresses of being in public—they don’t need an “emergency room.” But as they prepare to go out and meet friends or give a presentation at work, they can still appreciate a touch of old-school glamour.</p>

  </div><div><h2>How to buy college football players, in the words of a man who delivers the money</h2><div>

  <div>
    <p>The Bag Man excuses himself to make a call outside, on his "other phone," to arrange delivery of $500 in cash to a visiting recruit. The player is rated No. 1 at his position nationally and on his way into town. We're sitting in a popular restaurant near campus almost a week before National Signing Day, talking about how to arrange cash payments for amateur athletes.</p>
    <p>"Nah, there's no way we're landing him, but you still have to do it," he says. "It looks good. It's good for down the road. Same reason my wife reads Yelp. These kids talk to each other. It's a waste of money, but they're doing the same thing to our guys right now in [rival school's town]. Cost of business."</p>
    <p>Technically, this conversation never happened, because I won't reveal&nbsp;this man's name or the player's, or even the town I visited. Accordingly, all the other conversations I had with different bag men representing different SEC programs over a two-month span surrounding National Signing Day didn't happen either.</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>Even when I asked for and received proof -- in this case a phone call I watched him make to a number I independently verified, then a meeting in which I witnessed cash handed to an active SEC football player -- it's just cash changing hands. When things are done correctly, there's no proof more substantial than one man's word over another. That allows for plausible deniability, which is good enough for the coaches, administrators, conference officials, and network executives. And the man I officially&nbsp;didn't speak with was emphatic that no one really understands how often and how well it almost always works.</p>
    <p>These men are fans who believe they're leveraging football success $500 or $50,000 at a time. I can't show you that money, and neither can anyone else. You might think you see <i>the</i> money -- a flash of $20 bills all over some kid's Instagram or Facebook update -- but that's just&nbsp;money.</p>
    <p>This is the arrangement in high-stakes college football, though of course not every player is paid for. Providing cash and benefits to players is not a scandal or a scheme, merely a function. And when you start listening to the stories, you understand the function can never be stopped.</p>
    <p>"Last week I got a call. We've got this JUCO transfer that had just got here. And he's country poor. The [graduate assistant] calls me and tells me he's watching the AFC Championship Game alone in the lobby of the Union because he doesn't have a TV. Says he never owned one. Now, you can buy a Walmart TV for $50. What kid in college doesn't have a TV? So I don't give him any money. I just go dig out in my garage and find one of those old Vizios from five years back and leave it for him at the desk. I don't view what I do as a crime, and I don't give a shit if someone else does, honestly."</p>
    <p>"If we could take a vote for these kids to make a real salary every season, I would vote for it. $40,000 or something. Goes back to mama, buys them a car, lets them go live like normal people after they work their asses off for us. But let's be honest, that ain't gonna stop all this. If everyone gets $40,000, someone would still be trying to give 'em 40 extra on the side."</p>
    <p>This is how you become a college football bag man.</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>I. "Just hang out and learn to keep your mouth shut."</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>Chances are you didn't just wake up one day and decide that your passion for Team A was suddenly worth forking over money to entice and reward student-athletes. If you haven't already grown up in your team's culture, you start going to games, first as a student, then a young alum, then a married alum, and then as a young family. You become a person everyone in your age group knows has enough money that a low-five-figure deduction wouldn't be missed.</p>
    <p>One caveat. If you're stinking, filthy rich, a good athletic director or university fundraiser has already contacted you for above-board donations, and you likely won't get into the business of paying players. It's the guys with just about 10 or 15 grand to burn annually that usually become bag men.</p>
    <p>"I think it took me seven years. I knew some guys. They knew some older guys. And before, I really didn't believe any of this happened. Then I start coming around different events, parties, tailgates. After a while one guy says, 'Oh hey, I know him. It's okay, he loves the [team],' and starts talking who needed to get what. And so I was a part of it. I wanted to be."</p>
    <p>Once properly vetted, your money usually buys you first or secondhand access to information most fans (or journalists) would kill for: player run-ins with the law that go unreported, what certain coaches are really like, what kind of power an A.D. or president really has, and most importantly, who really is in charge of your football program.</p>
  </div>
  <div><span><h3>II. Discover Crootsylvania, the Pay-Me State.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>Southern states feature vastly different cultural, economic and physical territories, but every state with a school in the SEC contains a few consistent features from which a kind of map can be built:</p>
    <ul><li>
      <p>The university housing your team.</p>
    </li>
      <li>
        <p>A capital city. Your school likely has some concentration of lawyers or elected officials.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The metro area (sometimes also the capital), the state's most populated and therefore talent-rich area.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A community or city closest to your state's border with another conference state.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Enemy territory. Just as your team has boosters active in other states, so too are enemy agents inside your borders. In many cases they're concentrated in a single area, like an in-state rival's town, a town close to the border, or just an area with a concentration of sidewalk fans who support someone else.</p>
      </li>
    </ul><p>From these areas, borders are drawn and districts are created, but over time specific territories are shaped by the bag men in them. It's a somewhat fluid map, at least over long amounts of time.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the state, a school's bag men gravitate towards two centers of power: the university and the state's metro area, the latter because of population, the former because of power. Regardless of where top-dollar shadow boosters and bag men might live, the university town serves as the primary center of operations. After all, that's where the coaches and players are.</p>
  </div>
  <div><span><h3>III. Even shadow governments have staff meetings.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>Bag men tend to operate in plain sight. And while there might be a kind of cabal of particularly rich boosters who direct operations at private meetings, there aren't dungeons and robes or some kind of "X-Files" syndicate in a smoky boardroom.</p>
    <p>"No secret lair, although a couple guys have some pretty ridiculous-looking hunting camps. I mean, we're shooting the shit about college football players. That in and of itself isn't a crime. Sometimes we go to the Waffle House."</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>The rules of communication tend to follow your typical sleeper cell or drug-dealing outfit. Talk in person as much as possible, preferably in group settings. Don't use email. Never interact with the media and avoid the university's public relations or sports information departments whenever possible. And buy burners. Lots of burners.</p>
    <p>"It's the bat phone. Everybody has a bat phone. Buy some in a gas station out of town, use 'em for a while, toss 'em. The worst part was convincing my wife it wasn't so I could carry on an affair, because I wouldn't let her use it or see who I was talking to."</p>
    <p>Burners are seasonal and used mostly around the height of recruiting season, when local bag men need to communicate quickly with other shadow boosters across the state and region higher up the fiscal chain. Later on they'll be used to communicate directly with active players. But calls are often made to a person's primary number, and in a pinch basic code-talking will suffice.</p>
    <p>"I can call up a guy in real estate and say, 'Hey man, we thought about it, and let's do that 24-acre plot. How's a 4 p.m. meeting sound?'"</p>
    <p>The first number is the player, usually designated by a jersey number. Here, it's player No. 24. The time is the cost. In this example, $4,000. Listen long enough and it's not much of a code, but there's never been much to codebreaking here, either.</p>
    <p>"I don't sell drugs. I don't even speed on the highway. No one's listening to me."</p>
  </div>
  <div><span><h3>IV. (Don't) get to know your head coach.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>There's a weird code of personal conduct for a bag man. It's okay to be flashy, but within the limits. Set up your lavish tailgate, put a deposit down on a luxury box, or name your child after a famous player or coach. After all, you're passionate enough to be paying, so you might as well enjoy yourself.</p>
    <p>But while drawing attention to yourself is fine, drawing importance to yourself is forbidden. You are now somebody in one very small social circle but forever destined to be nobody in the public eye.</p>
    <p>"Coach has met me a few times. I've talked to Coach. But Coach doesn't really know me from Adam. How many other folks do you think he meets a week? After he got hired, I walked up and shook his hand, and the guy introducing us says, "Hey Coach, this here's [first name], he takes care of stuff for us.' Now, what does that really mean? Do I charter planes for the university? Do I run a company that sells concessions to the stadium? Or do I make sure kids get taken care of? Coach doesn't know what I 'take care of.' He knows someone out there is doing this, and that's all."</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>A good bag man will never be famous. He will never be that guy hovering right next to the head coach after a big win. His name will never be known by the majority of students, fans, and alumni of the university he loves. There is no dead bag man memorial on the campus of any football powerhouse. There are no memorial scholarships named after the guy who gave a running back's mother $3,000 a month for four years.</p>
    <p>"There's some guy I know. He's in the [official booster club for the university]. I've known him almost all my life; he's a friend of my family. Guy gives about $50,000 a year to the program. And so he gets to wear a jacket and have his name in the [annual alumni magazine] and gets to shake hands with the coaches and feel really goddamn important. I see this guy all the time, and we talk about the team, and he's always trying to big dick about how important he is to the program. Now let me ask you, who do you think is more important to this team winning next season? Him with his $50,000 getting bathrooms painted in the basketball arena, or what I do with not even a quarter of that much money?"</p>
    <p>Bottom line: if you're successful in landing a player who is in turn successful on the field, and you can't abide people not knowing you had a hand in the process, you're in the wrong field of athletic support.</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>V. There is never a bank account. There is only cash</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>You've probably read a detailed breakdown on some message board about how your rival school managed to land that prized wide receiver, and it probably involves something to do with a bank account.</p>
    <p>The player might have been bought, but he didn't pop into the local savings and loan to pick up his check. Bank accounts carry more potentially traceable information than any other facet of an illegal payments system, even more than phone records. Yet in almost every popular Internet rumor about a recruit's family being paid off, there's some mention of a bank account or a slush fund that boosters pay into and athletes take out of.</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>"If you hear stories about bank accounts, they're fake. Why would there be a bank account? Yeah, I'm gonna open a checking account with statements someone could subpoena. Oh and hey, in this small town of however-many-thousands of people I'm gonna go in and open some account and then ask for a bunch of black teenagers to be put on there and ask for a bunch of debit cards they could get caught with. Why don't I just take out a fucking ad?"</p>
    <p>There might not be a FDIC-insured savings account at a local bank branch, but there is always a pool from which money can be accessed quickly. A majority of fundraising occurs in the offseason, when coaches visit alumni and booster clubs throughout their schools' regions.</p>
    <p>"The coach or coaches come in, say their piece, bullshit with the folks and take pictures and then they're in the car and headed back home. When they leave, we start talking. What we figure out then is what we need to put together in that area [of the state] for anyone we're trying to land from that area. That's when the hat gets passed."</p>
    <p>The actual money is never collected in a single area, but a collective of shadow boosters keeps an unwritten counter on how much each of them can contribute in cash at any given moment for three major purposes:</p>
    <ol><li><span>Large single sums to be paid out in order to convince a recruit to sign with the school.</span></li>
      <li><span>Maintenance payments to current players, delivered in an ongoing basis.</span></li>
      <li><span>Cash owed by an out-of-area shadow booster to a bag man living in the college town. Sometimes a player whose sponsor lives back at home needs money immediately, so a local bag man not assigned to that player will pay the player, with a marker going to his booster back home.</span></li>
    </ol><p>The small business fuels America. Cash that doesn't have to be accounted for exists in any variety of ways. Sell a pair of lower bowl tickets to a guy you know from church? Cash. Sell a bass boat on Craigslist? Cash. Run or own a restaurant? Cash. Work in agriculture? Lots of cash.</p>
    <p>"We all do different things. Finding liquid capital is not a problem for any of us. If it was, we wouldn't be doing this."</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>VI. The rules of courting</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>Some towns or high schools have already made a recruit's decision before he's out of diapers. These are strongholds. The local money, the high school coaches and principals, the parents and the "uncles" are already all on the same team.</p>
    <p>This is built by heritage and takes decades and sometimes millions of dollars. Maybe it's a local business that employs working-class families. Jobs for parents can be arranged with ease, as can pressure on those currently employed.</p>
    <p>A player can be identified as a prospect in middle school, either by a coach friendly to your program or a bag man himself. A collegiate head coach would never inform a bag man of his preferences, but in a well-run program, his desires would be known without communicating them.</p>
    <p>Extenuating factors to consider when putting together a plan:</p>
    <ul><li>
      <p>What's the climate of the high school? Does the high school coach lean towards or away from your college program?</p>
    </li>
      <li>
        <p>Is this a stronghold town or disputed territory? How fast will competition come in? Or is someone already in with the family, meaning you're the competition?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What's the economic status of the family? Any criminal history? Could other incentives (jobs, cars) be arranged?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What is the family dynamic? Who other than the mother or grandmother is workable? ("I've never encountered a situation where a parent or guardian worried about the legality. I can't say that's ever even been asked of me.")</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Who is the one person that can be trusted to take payments before the player signs and keep the money out of public view?</p>
      </li>
    </ul><p>"If mama's been working all her life to provide, you can make that work. That's a very manageable situation. But if you've got an uncle talking about being the kid's manager or agent, talking about his rap label he's starting or interviews with ESPN, shit ... you better hold on, or reevaluate how bad you want this player."</p>
    <p>Often a full assessment of a recruit's situation reveals that a promise of cash payments isn't the way to go. Sometimes a recruit's family could be so far under the poverty line that any kind of sudden flush spending would draw the attention of the NCAA, or the recruit is so high-profile that he's receiving multiple cash gifts from competing boosters. That's when the personal touch becomes a better option.</p>
    <p>"I've paid to put a single mother through rehab. It was the recruit's older sister. He's playing ball and mama's raising two grandchildren, his sister's kids. Mama's tired and doesn't want to raise another set of kids. So we make the calls and arrange for the daughter to go to rehab, then set her up with a job when she's done. Fast track her to a job at a private business, nothing suspicious. Now mama can enjoy her son playing and the daughter is back on her feet. And when it came time to sign, we made sure she saw something [cash], but I promise you that meant more than just money."</p>
    <p>The most common non-cash gifts to recruits are cars. In every major city inside the Southeastern Conference's footprint is a tangle of auto dealerships with varying ties to particular schools.</p>


    <p>"There are jokes about kids getting cars, but that's actually pretty easy. We all have dealerships all over. You practically have to nowadays, anyway, just for the coaches. Think about it. Most schools, all the football, basketball, and baseball coaches and their wives are getting some kind of vehicle for free as part of their contract. Then they're turning them in every three years or so. That's a fleet right there. You need a lot of guys with dealerships, and you need them in different towns. Then getting a clean title on a member of the family is pretty easy."</p>
    <p>Whatever the minimum of necessary paperwork to absolve a player of improper benefits received is, it's not a problem. A title for a moderately priced SUV can be created in a relative's name, as can a receipt of sale for a reasonable price.</p>
    <p>"Hey, how'd he get that ride? His uncle bought it. How did his uncle buy it? Paid cash. Paid cash, how'd he do that? Shit, we don't know, but here's the receipt where he paid cash, and now y'all ain't got shit. Go tell the NCAA you think we're cheating because this kid's uncle bought him a used Tahoe in cash, you racist."</p>
    <p>Resources, assistance, paperwork, and even a subpar explanation mean most needs can be taken care of.</p>
    <p>"One time grandpa needed his tractor fixed. He and grandma were the primary care-givers of this kid out in a rural area. Well, they aren't going to turn down the money, and they didn't, but what they needed was a tractor to get fixed. But we couldn't take this tractor to get fixed just anywhere, because the guy who does that locally works for a business that's owned by a [rival school] fan."</p>
    <p>Why not just buy a new tractor?</p>
    <p>"Because that would be like a Lamborghini showing up in their driveway. See, you don't know how much a tractor costs. So we've got to get this tractor to a repair guy who we're comfortable enough calling up and saying, 'Hey, fix this. He's good for it. We're taking care of it.' The tractor gets fixed. Now you try and prove we fixed that tractor."</p>
    <p>What about a receipt?</p>
    <p>"You're a reporter. You can't demand a receipt from a private business. Besides, did you know that repair guy owed that farmer a favor? He did it for half the normal cost and the guy paid him in cash. You're not the IRS, anyway."</p>
    <p>And the NCAA?</p>
    <p>"He's a farmer. He got paid extra on a side job or made extra taking something to market. Paid for it that way. Whatever."</p>
    <p>Still, why not limit the interaction to simply providing the money for the repair? Why get so involved when it only increases potential complications or chances of exposure?</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>"Because of the competition. If we're after a guy, what are the chances four more schools in the SEC aren't after him too? What you want more than anything else is the ability to sit down with that decision-maker, grandma or mama or the uncle, right before the time comes and say, 'Hey, we know that old so-and-so from [rival school] has come to see you. That's fine. But we know you know who's been here since the beginning and who's been taking care of you.' You want them to believe that you'll take care of them the best in the future, too."</p>
    <p>Remember, your job as a bag man isn't to hide the benefit. It's to hide the proof. In a region as passionate about college football as the American South, there's no real moral outrage when new cars or clothes or jobs for relatives appear.</p>
    <p>"We can only get away with whatever's considered reasonable by the majority of the folks in our society. That's why it's different in the SEC. Maybe that's why we're able to be more active in what we do. Because no one ever looks at the car or the jewelry and says, 'How did you get that, poor football player?' They say, 'How did they get you that and not get caught, poor football player?'"</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>VII. You will know your enemy.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>Rural Southerners make a habit of knowing each other's business. Chances are you'll become aware of and -- believe it or not -- friends with bag men for rivals schools. Not that there's such a concept of friends in love or war.</p>
    <p>"It's a small group. If you grow up in the state, you end up knowing folks. It's really that simple. But that won't stop them from trying to bury your ass when it gets down to it. A few years back, we were fighting hard for a kid in their backyard. We went for a full year with the family, thought we had it wrapped up. Still thought we had it done the night before Signing Day. He liked our coaches. But the family keeps dragging it and dragging it. Late that night I get a call, and it's the player on the phone, the kid himself. You could tell he was nervous. He said, &lsquo;Mr. [name], I talked to my mama, and we decided that $70,000 and we're going with you, if you can promise us $70,000 tonight.' I knew right away we were being recorded, and I knew the asshole down there who had set it up. I knew him personally. They had him. That part was done. But they wanted to get someone on tape to try and turn it over to the NCAA. So I said, 'Well gosh [player name], we'd love to see you here next season, but we just don't do that kind of thing.' Then I hung up."</p>
    <p>The bag men associated with certain schools pay potential signees one-time bonus payments not to visit a rival school that's offered a scholarship. The going rate is stated to be $2,500. This has become a popular tactic in recent years, as the recruiting process has become more publicized.</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>"You can have a rival coach who is considered a great recruiter, and he might say, 'We feel great about this kid, if we can just get him on campus.' Well, what if you can't even get him to show up? How great a recruiter are you now?"</p>
    <p>This tactic is not universally employed. Some coaches encourage players to visit other campuses to recruit other players. Some like for everyone to know how many other schools have offered a player before he makes his choice, making it look like the chosen school beat an even longer list of rivals. Regardless, it's a shining example of how influential shadow boosters are in the recruiting process and how crucial they are to the success of a coach's reputation as a good recruiter.</p>
    <p>It's also how lame duck coaching staffs are created. If a majority of bag men want a particular coach out and an A.D. or president won't make a move, they'll just dry up funds.</p>
    <p>"The coach won't know exactly when we decide to make that happen, but they've got a good idea. Then we get to see just how damn good a recruiter he really is. I know one of our guys once stopped putting in big bucks, way more than what I do, just because a head coach cussed too much on the team plane. [The coach] was losing anyway, but because he took the Lord's name in vain, that guy was offended by his morality and stopped illegally paying college football players."</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>VIII. Small, simple and frequent.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>There's little use for an actual bag, especially once an athlete is signed and on campus. Rather than dole out large sums of money, the bag man usually prefers to hand over frequent payments of $200 to $500. It prevents the player from overspending, losing the money or getting robbed, and ...</p>
    <p>"I don't like to run around with thousands in cash on my person, either. This isn't 'Scarface.'"</p>
    <p>Think of how quickly the average student blows through a student loan check. The increased frequency of the meets help foster a better relationship, as each bag man is assigned or volunteers for particular players. The more often the meetings, the more casual and less clandestine they can become, but the level of maintenance can be stressful. This also means that bag men willing to either live in or near the university town are highly valued.</p>
    <p>This usually isn't a problem, as most college towns are considered desirable places to raise families and operate businesses.</p>
    <p>"I don't know how much some of the kids are getting. I just handle my guys. Obviously I know it's happening, but I can't tell you when or where or how much or how often. I just handle my guys."</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>IX. Just say no to bounties and bonuses.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>"I had this one kid, great player, good guy. Never got in trouble, but never did much on the field. But he's calling me all the time. 'Hey, the sunroof in my car is leaking,' he says, so I tell him to come meet me. $150. Two days later it's: 'Hey, I'm going out this weekend with a girl, can you help me?' $200. Next week after that he's got $300 in parking tickets. So one day I go to meet him to give him money and I ask, "Hey man, aren't you a business major? Have y'all learned what ROI means yet? It means return on investment, and at this rate I'm going to need to start seeing some touchdowns.'"</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>This is a newer wrinkle for the bag man. As a fan, the temptation might be to reward a player who's putting up great numbers, just as you might want to withhold from one who's thought to be showing poor effort. But as a businessperson, that's poor management. The 1980s Miami Hurricanes are in many ways a what-not-to-do guide for shadow boosters, but it was the system of incentives and bounties favored by 2000s Miami booster Nevin Shapiro that's shown the foolishness of incentives.</p>
    <p>Handing out $100 bills for interceptions or sacks used to seem like the bag man's top responsibility, but they've learned. Performance-based rewards require some kind of record-keeping, which is the first red light. The second is a potential for competition among players that could bleed over into animosity or somehow affect on-field efficiency.</p>
    <p>"I read the stuff Oklahoma State was accused of. The reason I don't believe a lot of it is because how stupid they come off. When they said players were getting cash envelopes handed out in the locker room after the game like it was Gatorade, I thought, 'surely this is a joke.' And if I was a player, stopped getting money because I was hurt or buried on the depth chart or was maybe playing through an injury you didn't know about, I'd go to the media, too."</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>X. You must keep the circle unbroken.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>College majors like Exercise Science and General Education have long been assailed by critics as crip-course degrees, but shadow boosters see them as a vital way to perpetuate the cycle. If a player finishes out his eligibility and has no feasible future in the pros, he might return home and become a nearby high school coach. It doesn't matter if it's junior high or seven-on-seven camps; each means a new brand ambassador for the program.</p>
    <p>"You win the gym teachers, and you can go a long way. That's why all those basket-weaving degrees are so important, because we need 'em on both ends. You need 'em to keep the kids qualified, and you need 'em to produce guys who can go back and coach and teach and help us."</p>
    <p>It doesn't hurt that the system produces agents who often become the most powerful male influence in a young athlete's life. And there is, of course, a fiscal incentive for the ex-athlete to help steer future players in the same direction he went. The bag man doesn't expect any coach to push 100 percent of his Division I-worthy talent to any one particular place, let alone his alma mater, but rather pick spots for the big ones.</p>
    <p>"Kids are going to grow up liking teams for one reason or another, but when it comes time to start seriously talking to them, you need as many folks as you can get. Mama wins almost every time. Mama's most important. But you get coaches with ties to the school, then you get one person who has all those kids' attention."</p>

    </div><br><p>This system and the men operating it want you to know that they don't succeed so often and raise the stakes so fearlessly because they're that good. It's because so many people care so much. There might not be a cultural mandate, but describing an October Saturday in the South as a culture accepting of this behavior would be a raging understatement.</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>"I'm not Nevin Shapiro. I'm not telling these kids to give another player a concussion. I'm not paying for abortions. It's 2014. Who's left to tell that would get angry? Who's left that would object to seeing these kids getting some money?"</p>
    <p>If you believe any of this happens with the frequency and level of organization described, you might assume that such practices surely couldn't go entirely unnoticed, that surely someone not involved in a conspiracy to illegally funnel money to college-aged athletes would expose the plot. It's happened before, after all.</p>
    <p>"It happens, yeah, but now we start to ask, &lsquo;Who would do that?' You try your damnedest to take care of everyone involved for a long as you can. Look at where we live. Look at how much everyone cares. Think about how much of a pariah any one of us would become if we spoke out, especially with no real evidence.</p>
    <p>"I look at this as an investment. When you ask me why I do this ... let me ask you something. Who's your favorite sports team? Most favorite. Who do you live and die with? What if I told you that if you gave me $10,000 right now I could guarantee you they'd be better? That if they were usually bad that they'd have a winning season? Or if they were just a game shy of going to a championship that they'd get there next season?"</p>
    <p>"Hey, man," he calls to the bartender.</p>
    <p>"If I told you right now the [team] would win the SEC this fall and go to the Playoff, but only if you gave me 10 grand, would you do it?"</p>
    <p>"Shit, man ... will you take a check?," the bartender asks. "But if you could really do that, I'd probably get the cash together in a day or two."</p>

      <li>
        <p>Who is the one person that can be trusted to take payments before the player signs and keep the money out of public view?</p>
      </li>
    </ul><p>"If mama's been working all her life to provide, you can make that work. That's a very manageable situation. But if you've got an uncle talking about being the kid's manager or agent, talking about his rap label he's starting or interviews with ESPN, shit ... you better hold on, or reevaluate how bad you want this player."</p>
    <p>Often a full assessment of a recruit's situation reveals that a promise of cash payments isn't the way to go. Sometimes a recruit's family could be so far under the poverty line that any kind of sudden flush spending would draw the attention of the NCAA, or the recruit is so high-profile that he's receiving multiple cash gifts from competing boosters. That's when the personal touch becomes a better option.</p>
    <p>"I've paid to put a single mother through rehab. It was the recruit's older sister. He's playing ball and mama's raising two grandchildren, his sister's kids. Mama's tired and doesn't want to raise another set of kids. So we make the calls and arrange for the daughter to go to rehab, then set her up with a job when she's done. Fast track her to a job at a private business, nothing suspicious. Now mama can enjoy her son playing and the daughter is back on her feet. And when it came time to sign, we made sure she saw something [cash], but I promise you that meant more than just money."</p>
    <p>The most common non-cash gifts to recruits are cars. In every major city inside the Southeastern Conference's footprint is a tangle of auto dealerships with varying ties to particular schools.</p>


    <p>"There are jokes about kids getting cars, but that's actually pretty easy. We all have dealerships all over. You practically have to nowadays, anyway, just for the coaches. Think about it. Most schools, all the football, basketball, and baseball coaches and their wives are getting some kind of vehicle for free as part of their contract. Then they're turning them in every three years or so. That's a fleet right there. You need a lot of guys with dealerships, and you need them in different towns. Then getting a clean title on a member of the family is pretty easy."</p>
    <p>Whatever the minimum of necessary paperwork to absolve a player of improper benefits received is, it's not a problem. A title for a moderately priced SUV can be created in a relative's name, as can a receipt of sale for a reasonable price.</p>
    <p>"Hey, how'd he get that ride? His uncle bought it. How did his uncle buy it? Paid cash. Paid cash, how'd he do that? Shit, we don't know, but here's the receipt where he paid cash, and now y'all ain't got shit. Go tell the NCAA you think we're cheating because this kid's uncle bought him a used Tahoe in cash, you racist."</p>
    <p>Resources, assistance, paperwork, and even a subpar explanation mean most needs can be taken care of.</p>
    <p>"One time grandpa needed his tractor fixed. He and grandma were the primary care-givers of this kid out in a rural area. Well, they aren't going to turn down the money, and they didn't, but what they needed was a tractor to get fixed. But we couldn't take this tractor to get fixed just anywhere, because the guy who does that locally works for a business that's owned by a [rival school] fan."</p>
    <p>Why not just buy a new tractor?</p>
    <p>"Because that would be like a Lamborghini showing up in their driveway. See, you don't know how much a tractor costs. So we've got to get this tractor to a repair guy who we're comfortable enough calling up and saying, 'Hey, fix this. He's good for it. We're taking care of it.' The tractor gets fixed. Now you try and prove we fixed that tractor."</p>
    <p>What about a receipt?</p>
    <p>"You're a reporter. You can't demand a receipt from a private business. Besides, did you know that repair guy owed that farmer a favor? He did it for half the normal cost and the guy paid him in cash. You're not the IRS, anyway."</p>
    <p>And the NCAA?</p>
    <p>"He's a farmer. He got paid extra on a side job or made extra taking something to market. Paid for it that way. Whatever."</p>
    <p>Still, why not limit the interaction to simply providing the money for the repair? Why get so involved when it only increases potential complications or chances of exposure?</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>"Because of the competition. If we're after a guy, what are the chances four more schools in the SEC aren't after him too? What you want more than anything else is the ability to sit down with that decision-maker, grandma or mama or the uncle, right before the time comes and say, 'Hey, we know that old so-and-so from [rival school] has come to see you. That's fine. But we know you know who's been here since the beginning and who's been taking care of you.' You want them to believe that you'll take care of them the best in the future, too."</p>
    <p>Remember, your job as a bag man isn't to hide the benefit. It's to hide the proof. In a region as passionate about college football as the American South, there's no real moral outrage when new cars or clothes or jobs for relatives appear.</p>
    <p>"We can only get away with whatever's considered reasonable by the majority of the folks in our society. That's why it's different in the SEC. Maybe that's why we're able to be more active in what we do. Because no one ever looks at the car or the jewelry and says, 'How did you get that, poor football player?' They say, 'How did they get you that and not get caught, poor football player?'"</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>VII. You will know your enemy.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>Rural Southerners make a habit of knowing each other's business. Chances are you'll become aware of and -- believe it or not -- friends with bag men for rivals schools. Not that there's such a concept of friends in love or war.</p>
    <p>"It's a small group. If you grow up in the state, you end up knowing folks. It's really that simple. But that won't stop them from trying to bury your ass when it gets down to it. A few years back, we were fighting hard for a kid in their backyard. We went for a full year with the family, thought we had it wrapped up. Still thought we had it done the night before Signing Day. He liked our coaches. But the family keeps dragging it and dragging it. Late that night I get a call, and it's the player on the phone, the kid himself. You could tell he was nervous. He said, &lsquo;Mr. [name], I talked to my mama, and we decided that $70,000 and we're going with you, if you can promise us $70,000 tonight.' I knew right away we were being recorded, and I knew the asshole down there who had set it up. I knew him personally. They had him. That part was done. But they wanted to get someone on tape to try and turn it over to the NCAA. So I said, 'Well gosh [player name], we'd love to see you here next season, but we just don't do that kind of thing.' Then I hung up."</p>
    <p>The bag men associated with certain schools pay potential signees one-time bonus payments not to visit a rival school that's offered a scholarship. The going rate is stated to be $2,500. This has become a popular tactic in recent years, as the recruiting process has become more publicized.</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>"You can have a rival coach who is considered a great recruiter, and he might say, 'We feel great about this kid, if we can just get him on campus.' Well, what if you can't even get him to show up? How great a recruiter are you now?"</p>
    <p>This tactic is not universally employed. Some coaches encourage players to visit other campuses to recruit other players. Some like for everyone to know how many other schools have offered a player before he makes his choice, making it look like the chosen school beat an even longer list of rivals. Regardless, it's a shining example of how influential shadow boosters are in the recruiting process and how crucial they are to the success of a coach's reputation as a good recruiter.</p>
    <p>It's also how lame duck coaching staffs are created. If a majority of bag men want a particular coach out and an A.D. or president won't make a move, they'll just dry up funds.</p>
    <p>"The coach won't know exactly when we decide to make that happen, but they've got a good idea. Then we get to see just how damn good a recruiter he really is. I know one of our guys once stopped putting in big bucks, way more than what I do, just because a head coach cussed too much on the team plane. [The coach] was losing anyway, but because he took the Lord's name in vain, that guy was offended by his morality and stopped illegally paying college football players."</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>VIII. Small, simple and frequent.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>There's little use for an actual bag, especially once an athlete is signed and on campus. Rather than dole out large sums of money, the bag man usually prefers to hand over frequent payments of $200 to $500. It prevents the player from overspending, losing the money or getting robbed, and ...</p>
    <p>"I don't like to run around with thousands in cash on my person, either. This isn't 'Scarface.'"</p>
    <p>Think of how quickly the average student blows through a student loan check. The increased frequency of the meets help foster a better relationship, as each bag man is assigned or volunteers for particular players. The more often the meetings, the more casual and less clandestine they can become, but the level of maintenance can be stressful. This also means that bag men willing to either live in or near the university town are highly valued.</p>
    <p>This usually isn't a problem, as most college towns are considered desirable places to raise families and operate businesses.</p>
    <p>"I don't know how much some of the kids are getting. I just handle my guys. Obviously I know it's happening, but I can't tell you when or where or how much or how often. I just handle my guys."</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>IX. Just say no to bounties and bonuses.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>"I had this one kid, great player, good guy. Never got in trouble, but never did much on the field. But he's calling me all the time. 'Hey, the sunroof in my car is leaking,' he says, so I tell him to come meet me. $150. Two days later it's: 'Hey, I'm going out this weekend with a girl, can you help me?' $200. Next week after that he's got $300 in parking tickets. So one day I go to meet him to give him money and I ask, "Hey man, aren't you a business major? Have y'all learned what ROI means yet? It means return on investment, and at this rate I'm going to need to start seeing some touchdowns.'"</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>This is a newer wrinkle for the bag man. As a fan, the temptation might be to reward a player who's putting up great numbers, just as you might want to withhold from one who's thought to be showing poor effort. But as a businessperson, that's poor management. The 1980s Miami Hurricanes are in many ways a what-not-to-do guide for shadow boosters, but it was the system of incentives and bounties favored by 2000s Miami booster Nevin Shapiro that's shown the foolishness of incentives.</p>
    <p>Handing out $100 bills for interceptions or sacks used to seem like the bag man's top responsibility, but they've learned. Performance-based rewards require some kind of record-keeping, which is the first red light. The second is a potential for competition among players that could bleed over into animosity or somehow affect on-field efficiency.</p>
    <p>"I read the stuff Oklahoma State was accused of. The reason I don't believe a lot of it is because how stupid they come off. When they said players were getting cash envelopes handed out in the locker room after the game like it was Gatorade, I thought, 'surely this is a joke.' And if I was a player, stopped getting money because I was hurt or buried on the depth chart or was maybe playing through an injury you didn't know about, I'd go to the media, too."</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>X. You must keep the circle unbroken.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>College majors like Exercise Science and General Education have long been assailed by critics as crip-course degrees, but shadow boosters see them as a vital way to perpetuate the cycle. If a player finishes out his eligibility and has no feasible future in the pros, he might return home and become a nearby high school coach. It doesn't matter if it's junior high or seven-on-seven camps; each means a new brand ambassador for the program.</p>
    <p>"You win the gym teachers, and you can go a long way. That's why all those basket-weaving degrees are so important, because we need 'em on both ends. You need 'em to keep the kids qualified, and you need 'em to produce guys who can go back and coach and teach and help us."</p>
    <p>It doesn't hurt that the system produces agents who often become the most powerful male influence in a young athlete's life. And there is, of course, a fiscal incentive for the ex-athlete to help steer future players in the same direction he went. The bag man doesn't expect any coach to push 100 percent of his Division I-worthy talent to any one particular place, let alone his alma mater, but rather pick spots for the big ones.</p>
    <p>"Kids are going to grow up liking teams for one reason or another, but when it comes time to start seriously talking to them, you need as many folks as you can get. Mama wins almost every time. Mama's most important. But you get coaches with ties to the school, then you get one person who has all those kids' attention."</p>

    </div><br><p>This system and the men operating it want you to know that they don't succeed so often and raise the stakes so fearlessly because they're that good. It's because so many people care so much. There might not be a cultural mandate, but describing an October Saturday in the South as a culture accepting of this behavior would be a raging understatement.</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>"I'm not Nevin Shapiro. I'm not telling these kids to give another player a concussion. I'm not paying for abortions. It's 2014. Who's left to tell that would get angry? Who's left that would object to seeing these kids getting some money?"</p>
    <p>If you believe any of this happens with the frequency and level of organization described, you might assume that such practices surely couldn't go entirely unnoticed, that surely someone not involved in a conspiracy to illegally funnel money to college-aged athletes would expose the plot. It's happened before, after all.</p>
    <p>"It happens, yeah, but now we start to ask, &lsquo;Who would do that?' You try your damnedest to take care of everyone involved for a long as you can. Look at where we live. Look at how much everyone cares. Think about how much of a pariah any one of us would become if we spoke out, especially with no real evidence.</p>
    <p>"I look at this as an investment. When you ask me why I do this ... let me ask you something. Who's your favorite sports team? Most favorite. Who do you live and die with? What if I told you that if you gave me $10,000 right now I could guarantee you they'd be better? That if they were usually bad that they'd have a winning season? Or if they were just a game shy of going to a championship that they'd get there next season?"</p>
    <p>"Hey, man," he calls to the bartender.</p>
    <p>"If I told you right now the [team] would win the SEC this fall and go to the Playoff, but only if you gave me 10 grand, would you do it?"</p>
    <p>"Shit, man ... will you take a check?," the bartender asks. "But if you could really do that, I'd probably get the cash together in a day or two."</p>

<div><div><p>In early 2009, three years prior to Taco Bell&rsquo;s 50th anniversary, CEO Greg Creed was already experiencing something of a midlife crisis. &ldquo;Our target audience is [customers] in their 20s. Turning 50 makes us sound old, and I didn&rsquo;t want to sound old,&rdquo; Creed explains. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;When we have our birthday, I don&rsquo;t want a cake or a celebration.'&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>So he issued a bold directive to his team instead: &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;[let&rsquo;s] reinvent the crunchy taco,'&rdquo; Creed recalls.</p><p>&ldquo;He was really looking for a big innovation to coincide with our anniversary,&rdquo; says Taco Bell brand marketing director Stephanie Perdue, who helped Creed write the original team brief. Creed explains: &ldquo;If you look at all the buns the burger boys sell, and the bread at Subway, they are forever coming up with a new bread bun. The crunchy taco: It was yellow and made of corn. We sold a couple billion of them, but there had been no innovation.&rdquo; He gave his staff until March 2012&ndash;slightly under three years&ndash;to pull off a complete rethink of traditional Mexican cuisine.</p><q>If you look at all the buns the burger boys sell, and the bread at Subway, they are forever coming up with a new bread bun.</q><p>The team soon assembled for an all-day ideation session at Taco Bell headquarters, where 30 different product concepts were considered, Perdue says, including new forms of burritos, nachos, and taquitos. But one idea, from Doritos-maker Frito-Lay, stuck out: a Doritos-based taco shell pocketed with Taco Bell ingredients. &ldquo;It was basically an image [of this taco] on a piece of paper, with a written description. I don&rsquo;t know what technology they use. We didn&rsquo;t even taste it; it was just more of, &lsquo;Hey, this is what it could look like,'&rdquo; Perdue says. &ldquo;It was like, &lsquo;Holy crap!&rsquo; Nobody had ever done this before: turning a Dorito into a taco shell. It was just mind-blowing at the idea stage.&rdquo; Steve Gomez, Taco Bell&rsquo;s food innovation expert, recalls seeing the first mock-up. &ldquo;Every day I see a lot of concepts&ndash;sketches on paper, written words about products&ndash;and my job is to turn those products into reality,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But in all my years as a product developer, I&rsquo;ve never seen a concept like this. The product didn&rsquo;t even exist yet, and already people knew this idea was going to be huge.&rdquo;</p><figure>

  </div></figure><p>Like any serious renovation, Taco Bell&rsquo;s started with a trip to Home Depot. It was April 2009. To show executives how the companies could fuse the flavor of Doritos with taco shells, the dev teams &ldquo;basically went out to Home Depot to buy a paint-spray gun, and then sprayed [Doritos] flavoring onto our existing yellow corn tacos,&rdquo; recalls Creed, with a chuckle. &ldquo;It was pretty funny watching people from behind glass spraying our tacos with a paint gun. But it was enough for us to know conceptually that we had a big idea.&rdquo;</p><p>Creed jokes now that &ldquo;really smart people got together with a spray gun and the rest is history.&rdquo; But that glosses over the true story behind the Doritos Locos Taco, as it came to be known. After the company completed a round of concept testing with 200 consumers, which indicated stellar demand for the Doritos Locos Taco, Gomez&rsquo;s team created an edible version using Taco Bell&rsquo;s yellow corn shell and Doritos&rsquo; Nacho Cheese seasoning. &ldquo;The way you might put powder sugar on cookies, that&rsquo;s basically the way we applied this seasoning [to our tacos],&rdquo; Gomez recalls.</p><figure>

  </div></figure><p>At last, consumers got a taste. But after all the concept drawings and testing, trips to Home Depot, and prototype development, initial consumer taste tests flopped, to the disappointment of the team. &ldquo;They completely called us out,&rdquo; Perdue says. Gomez recalls feeling crushed. &ldquo;It was total buzzkill in the room,&rdquo; he says.</p></div><div><h2><a>&iquest;Por Qu&eacute;?</a></h2><p>Even though the first tests failed to impress sample consumers, Taco Bell had forged the foundation for its biggest innovation in decades: the Doritos Locos Taco&ndash;either a revolutionary product or a low point for fast food, depending on your perspective. But there&rsquo;s no debating the success of the DLT, as it&rsquo;s called internally. Since it launched in early 2012, Taco Bell has sold more than 450 million Doritos Locos Tacos. A Cool Ranch follow-up, introduced in March, has already sold millions of units. &ldquo;We had to hire about 15,000 people last year&ndash;two to three per restaurant&ndash;in order to handle the sales growth and demand of the Doritos Locos Tacos business,&rdquo; Creed says. Taco Bell is now planning to roll out more Doritos-flavored products, and Frito-Lay has even announced that it will offer Taco Bell-flavored Doritos.</p><q>I mean, it was actually important that we left the orange dusting on your fingers because otherwise, we&rsquo;re not delivering the genuine Doritos [experience].</q><p>The real tale of how the DLT emerged from disappointing tests to become a massive hit involves a range of challenges and innovations, especially in engineering and manufacturing. &ldquo;We knew this was a breakthrough idea, so we put on our relentless hats and were determined to not let [this thing] beat us,&rdquo; Creed says.</p><p>For the first group of testers, the problem was the taste. The combination of Doritos with Taco Bell&rsquo;s shells didn&rsquo;t capture either the zest of Doritos chips or the punch of Taco Bell&rsquo;s tacos. Rather, they formed a displeasing amalgamation of the two flavor profiles. &ldquo;This idea of merging a chip and a shell together&ndash;it sounds simple, but it&rsquo;s very hard to make a reality,&rdquo; Gomez says. &ldquo;To tackle this huge challenge, for months we shared know-how between the technical teams at Frito-Lay and Taco Bell.&rdquo;</p><h2><a>Think Outside The Bun</a></h2><p>The central issue was that Taco Bell&rsquo;s shells used a different type of corn masa than Doritos chips. But it wasn&rsquo;t simply a matter of adjusting the recipe. In order to create the DLT, the teams had to consider everything from seasoning mechanics to the taco&rsquo;s structural integrity throughout 2010 and 2011. &ldquo;Frito-Lay wanted what&rsquo;s called a &lsquo;teeth-rattling crunch,&rsquo; so they wanted it to snap and crunch more than the current Taco Bell shell snaps and crunches,&rdquo; Creed says. &ldquo;So we had to get that formula changed, then we had to find a way to deliver the flavoring, and then the seasoning. I mean, it was actually important that we left the orange dusting on your fingers because otherwise, we&rsquo;re not delivering the genuine Doritos [experience].&rdquo;</p><q>There were some [prototypes] where we would barely even touch them and the shell would break.</q><p>All in, the teams experimented with more than 40 recipes over two years. During that time, the teams faced several roadblocks. &ldquo;Remember, a taco shell has to bend, so we had to make this crispy [like a chip], but we also had to make it be able to bend so it didn&rsquo;t crack,&rdquo; Creed says. &ldquo;This was a really big engineering challenge, [especially considering] we would have to make hundreds of millions of these shells.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When you buy a bag of Doritos and you open it, and some of the corners are broken off, you&rsquo;re probably not going to be that mad, because they&rsquo;re still Doritos,&rdquo; Gomez says. &ldquo;But if our taco shells are broken in transit or in the restaurants, we can&rsquo;t do anything with them. That was a big obstacle for us. How do we make these shells chip-like, but also be able to ship them and still be able to build a taco without having them break? There were some [prototypes] where we would barely even touch them and the shell would break.&rdquo;</p></div><div><figure>

    </div>
  </div><br></figure><p>Seasoning was another major issue, which was as much of a challenge of taste as it was for manufacturing. &ldquo;A Doritos chip is a flat triangle, and it gets seasoned by being tumbled around in a huge seasoner barrel that rotates. But we couldn&rsquo;t do that with a taco shell because they would break. We could get the seasoning to stick to the top but we couldn&rsquo;t get it to stick to the bottom&ndash;we just couldn&rsquo;t get it evenly coated,&rdquo; Creed recalls. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to take one big bite at one end, and it has flavor and the other end has nothing. We had to make sure it was evenly distributed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was the really tricky part,&rdquo; Gomez says. &ldquo;Just like anything in manufacturing, it&rsquo;s all about speed and efficiency. So our seasoner had to season shells fast and it had to season them right every single time. We had teams of engineers working day and night to get the seasoner working.&rdquo;</p><q>In the facilities, we couldn&rsquo;t have all that stuff in the air. It would&rsquo;ve been too much seasoning and flavor for our workers.</q><p>In fact, the companies ended up creating a proprietary seasoner in the process, not least because for workers on the manufacturing line, the plumes of Doritos seasoning would create an almost Nacho Cheese gas chamber. &ldquo;We realized pretty quickly that we had to seal that all in, because in the facilities, we couldn&rsquo;t have all that stuff in the air,&rdquo; Creed says. &ldquo;It would&rsquo;ve been too much seasoning and flavor for our workers. We had to enclose it so the seasoning wouldn&rsquo;t escape. It would&rsquo;ve been overpowering.&rdquo; [<em>Eds. note: Not a bad way to go.</em>]</p><p>Gomez admits to losing faith at times. &ldquo;There was a tremendous amount of pressure. There were days when we would get bummed out and worried that this would be too hard to pull off,&rdquo; he says. But eventually his team refined and narrowed down the recipes to three prototypes, which were readied for market testing. Creed says &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little bit of black box magic&rdquo; that went into the final prototype of the DLT, &ldquo;which not many people have seen.&rdquo; He won&rsquo;t elaborate, but regardless of the secret recipe, the true beauty of the DLT is its deceptively basic concept.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really one of those breathtakingly simple but huge ideas,&rdquo; Creed says. &ldquo;I remember trying to sell guacamole in the Midwest and people were like, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s all this green stuff in my burrito?&rsquo; But this was a fastball, down the middle. It&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d expect from Taco Bell, but supercharged.&rdquo;</p><h2><a>I Would Walk 900 Miles</a></h2><p>By September 2011, Taco Bell had rolled out the DLT prototype at a handful of restaurants in a few cities around the country for testing. Soon, hype around the DLT spread like lukewarm baja sauce. Customers began blogging about their experience; a slew of video reviews hit YouTube; and one Taco Bell addict even drove 900 miles from New York to Toledo, OH for an early taste of the DLT. &ldquo;They were just fanatical, and the results were off the charts,&rdquo; Stephanie Perdue says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen so much word of mouth generated for one single product.&rdquo;</p></div><div><figure>

  </div></figure><p>But while buzz for the DLT&rsquo;s national launch was locked in, a deal between Taco Bell and Frito-Lay was not. As Taco Bell legend has it, though the companies had spent years working together on the DLT, no official contracts had ever been signed. Taco Bell&rsquo;s 50th birthday was fast approaching when Greg Creed and then-Frito-Lay CEO Al Carey met in Creed&rsquo;s office to hash out final details. &ldquo;We both realized that if we let the lawyers get involved, this thing would get slowed down and bogged down. So we did a handshake deal&ndash;that&rsquo;s all we had: You&rsquo;re going to spend the money, and I&rsquo;m going to spend the money [on the DLT],&rdquo; Creed recalls. &ldquo;Everyone was like, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t launch without a contract.&rsquo; And we were like, &lsquo;Just watch us.'&rdquo;</p><p>Legal wrangling aside, meeting demand for the DLT was another problem for Taco Bell. &ldquo;We were going from three cities to 6,000 restaurants,&rdquo; Perdue says. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have the manufacturing capacity.&rdquo; Adds Gomez, &ldquo;How do we stockpile millions of shells to be ready for a launch of this magnitude?&rdquo;</p><p>Initially, the company thought its suppliers could build two dedicated DLT lines to produce enough shells to meet demand. &ldquo;We built a pilot plant, but then we sold so many that we were like, &lsquo;Whoops, we got a problem,'&rdquo; Creed says. Taco Bell&rsquo;s suppliers ended up building six dedicated manufacturing lines for the DLT, which are handled by roughly 600 employees. In fact, the Cool Ranch version of the DLT was originally supposed to launch late last year, instead of in March 2013, but it was delayed to add more manufacturing lines. &ldquo;We realized we needed more capacity, because we couldn&rsquo;t slow down the Nacho Cheese line in order to create capacity for Cool Ranch,&rdquo; Creed says.</p><p>When the DLT went nationwide, it was a smash hit, with millions of tacos sold in the first week on the market alone. &ldquo;When it launched, there was a significant impact&ndash;Taco Bell&rsquo;s [sales] numbers were up 13% in the second quarter of last year, which is big,&rdquo; explains Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass. &ldquo;Brands like Taco Bell or McDonald&rsquo;s or Wendy&rsquo;s&ndash;you just don&rsquo;t see double-digit [growth] in same-store sales.&rdquo;</p><q>It&rsquo;s not just a product; it&rsquo;s now a platform&ndash;Nacho Cheese, Cool Ranch, Flamas.</q><p>Soon, a contract was written up between Taco Bell and Frito-Lay, according to Creed.</p><p>&ldquo;When we met in my office [before launch], we said that if either one of us gets sacked or promoted, we would actually have to write a contract,&rdquo; Creed recalls. &ldquo;When [then-Frito-Lay CEO] Al [Carey] got promoted to run the PepsiCo beverage business, I phoned him up and said, &lsquo;So I guess we better write that contract then.&rsquo; Well guess what? We sold 100 million tacos in the first 70 days. If we waited for those contracts to be finished, we would&rsquo;ve sold 100 million less.&rdquo;</p></div><div><h2><a>Flamas Future</a></h2><p>After Nacho Cheese and Cool Ranch, a spicy Doritos Flamas-flavored taco is next on the docket. But that&rsquo;s not all the company has in the works. &ldquo;Someone said to me, &lsquo;Well, when you launch three or four of these things you&rsquo;ll run out of ideas,'&rdquo; Creed says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;Not really.'&rdquo;</p><p>To Creed, the partnership between Taco Bell and Frito-Lay is more than a one-off collaboration. Like Android is to Google or iOS is to Apple, Doritos-based flavors represent a whole new framework for Taco Bell to build on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just a product; it&rsquo;s now a platform&ndash;Nacho Cheese, Cool Ranch, Flamas,&rdquo; Creed beams. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to blow everyone away in the next few years in terms of how big this idea and platform will become.&rdquo;</p><p>The company is now considering crowdsourcing the next iteration of the DLT, and with 123 flavors of Doritos, there&rsquo;s certainly no shortage of possibilities. But perhaps more compelling than the company&rsquo;s innovations in taco shells are its plans to rethink what goes inside the DLT. Creed gives <em>Fast Company</em> the scoop: &ldquo;At the moment, all the ingredients we have inside these shells are the same. The shells keep changing, but the ingredients are still ground beef, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Well, we got a load of other flavors at Taco Bell, and we could put a whole lot of different ingredients inside those shells that would create a different taste and sensation.&rdquo;</p><q>We&rsquo;re going to blow everyone away in the next few years in terms of how big this idea and platform will become.</q><p>When pressed, Creed would only say it could be different &ldquo;proteins or a special sauce.&rdquo; Additionally, customers themselves are already experimenting with their own reinventions of the DLT. &ldquo;The Cheesy Gordita Crunch people are asking us to make one with either a Nacho Cheese or Cool Ranch shell,&rdquo; Creed says. That&rsquo;s likely to come down the road.</p><figure>

There&rsquo;s already a burrito with Fritos in it. Could you do Doritos nachos? A Doritos taco salad? Maybe. Creative guys will come up with different ways to use the same idea in ways we hadn&rsquo;t thought of before.&rdquo;</p><p>However complex the DLT line eventually becomes, the innovation behind the idea is its elegant simplicity, according to Creed. The combination of Doritos and Taco Bell, he says, is just so universally appealing that it&rsquo;s feeding its success in the market and driving its place in pop culture.</p></div></div><style>

<p>How long does it take to become elite at your craft? And what do the people who master their goals do differently than the rest of us?</p>
<p>That's what John Hayes, a cognitive psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University, wanted to know.</p>
<p>For decades, Hayes has been investigating the role of effort, practice, and knowledge in top performers. He has studied the most talented creators in history &mdash; people like Mozart and Picasso &mdash; to determine how long it took them to become world class at their craft. Furthermore, he has investigated the choices and experiences that have led to their success.</p>
<p>Let's talk about what Hayes has discovered about world class performers. And more importantly, let's discuss how you can use these insights to achieve your goals and become your best.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;10 Years of Silence&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Hayes started his research by examining successful composers. He analyzed thousands of musical pieces produced between the years of 1685 to 1900. The central question that drove his work was, &ldquo;How long after one becomes interested in music is it that one becomes world class?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventually, Hayes developed a list of 500 pieces that were played frequently by symphonies around the world and were considered to be the &ldquo;masterworks&rdquo; in the field. These 500 popular pieces were created by a total of 76 composers.</p>
<p>Next, Hayes mapped out the timeline of each composer's career and calculated how long they had been working before they created their popular works. What he discovered was that virtually every single &ldquo;masterwork&rdquo; was written after year ten of the composer's career. (Out of 500 pieces there were only three exceptions, which were written in years eight and nine.)</p>
<p>Not a single person produced incredible work without putting in a decade of practice first. Even a genius like Mozart had to work for at least ten years before he produced something that became popular. Professor Hayes began to refer to this period, which was filled with hard work and little recognition, as the &ldquo;ten years of silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In followup studies, Hayes found similar patterns among famous painters and popular poets. These findings have been further confirmed by research from professors like K. Anders Ericsson, who produced research that revealed that you needed to put in &ldquo;10,000 hours&rdquo; to become an expert in your field. (This idea was later popularized by Malcolm Gladwell.)</p>
<p>However, as Hayes, Ericsson, and other researchers started digging deeper, they discovered that time was merely one part of the equation. Success wasn&rsquo;t simply a product of 10 years of practice or 10,000 hours of work. To understand exactly what was required to maximize your potential and master your craft, you had to look at <em>how</em> the best performers practiced.</p>
<p>The practice habits of NBA superstar Kobe Bryant provide a perfect example&hellip;</p>
<h2>How Kobe Bryant Made it to the Top</h2>
<p>Kobe Bryant is one of the most successful basketball players of all&ndash;time. The winner of 5 NBA championships and 2 Olympic Gold Medals, Bryant has amassed a net worth of more than $200 million during his playing career.</p>
<p>In 2012, Bryant was selected as a member of Team USA. During this time, one of the athletic trainer's for Team USA, a man named Robert, was working with Kobe to prepare for the Olympics. In the story below, which was previously published on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/19o38z/hi_rnba_my_name_is_robert_and_im_an_athletic/">Reddit</a>, Robert describes his first experience with Kobe and reveals one of the reasons the superstar has become so successful.</p>
<p><strong>From Robert, trainer for Team USA:</strong></p>
<p>I was invited to Las Vegas to help Team USA with their conditioning before they headed off to London. I've had the opportunity to work with Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade in the past, but this would be my first interaction with Kobe.</p>
<p>The night before the first scrimmage, I had just watched &ldquo;Casablanca&rdquo; for the first time and it was about 3:30 AM.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, I was in bed, slowly fading away, when I heard my cell ring. It was Kobe. I nervously picked up.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Hey, uhh, Rob, I hope I'm not disturbing anything right?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhh, no. What's up Kob?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Just wondering if you could help me out with some conditioning work, that's all.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I checked my clock. 4:15 AM.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah sure, I'll see you in the facility in a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took me about twenty minutes to get my gear and get out of the hotel. When I arrived and opened the room to the main practice floor, I saw Kobe. Alone. He was drenched in sweat as if he had just taken a swim. It wasn't even 5:00 AM.</p>
<p>We did some conditioning work for the next hour and fifteen minutes. Then, we entered the weight room, where he would do a multitude of strength training exercises for the next 45 minutes. After that, we parted ways. He went back to the practice floor to shoot. I went back to the hotel and crashed. Wow.</p>
<p>I was expected to be at the floor again at about 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>I woke up feeling sleepy, drowsy, and pretty much every side effect of sleep deprivation. (Thanks, Kobe.) I had a bagel and headed to the practice facility.</p>
<p>This next part I remember very vividly. All of the Team USA players were there. LeBron was talking to Carmelo and Coach Krzyzewski was trying to explain something to Kevin Durant. On the right side of the practice facility Kobe was by himself shooting jumpers.</p>
<p>I went over to him, patted him on the back and said, &ldquo;Good work this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Like, the conditioning. Good work.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Oh. Yeah, thanks Rob. I really appreciate it.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;So when did you finish?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Finish what?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting your shots up. What time did you leave the facility?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Oh, just now. I wanted 800 makes. So yeah, just now.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>For those of you keeping track at home, Kobe Bryant started his conditioning work around 4:30am, continued to run and sprint until 6am, lifted weights from 6am to 7am, and finally proceeded to make 800 jump shots between 7am and 11am.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and then Team USA had practice.</p>
<p>It's obvious that Kobe is getting his 10,000 hours in, but there is another part of his story that is even more important.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Deliberate Practice</h2>
<p>Kobe isn&rsquo;t merely showing up and practicing a lot. He is practicing with purpose.</p>
<p>Kobe had a very clear goal at practice: 800 made jump shots. He was deliberately focused on developing the skill of making baskets. The time he spent doing it was almost an after thought. That sounds simple, but it&rsquo;s very different from how most of us approach our work each day.</p>
<p>When most people talk about working hard, they use the amount of time they worked as an indicator of how hard they worked. (i.e. <em>&ldquo;I worked 60 hours this week!&rdquo;</em>)</p>
<p>Putting in a lot of time might make you tired, but simply working a lot (even if it's 10,000 hours over the course of your career) isn't enough to make you a top performer. It's not the same thing as <a href="https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice">practicing deliberately</a>. Most people who think they are working hard are merely developing the skill of being in the gym, not the skill of making baskets.</p>
<p>To keep this basketball analogy going, consider this quote about deliberate practice&hellip;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Consider the activity of two basketball players practicing free throws for one hour. Player A shoots 200 practice shots, Player B shoots 50. The Player B retrieves his own shots, dribbles leisurely and takes several breaks to talk to friends. Player A has a colleague who retrieves the ball after each attempt. The colleague keeps a record of shots made. If the shot is missed the colleague records whether the miss was short, long, left or right and the shooter reviews the results after every 10 minutes of practice. To characterize their hour of practice as equal would hardly be accurate. Assuming this is typical of their practice routine and they are equally skilled at the start, which would you predict would be the better shooter after only 100 hours of practice?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&mdash;</em>Aubrey Daniels</p>
<p>Each player in the example above could brag about practicing for one hour, but only one of them is practicing deliberately.</p>
<p>Researchers have noted that top performers in every industry are committed to deliberate practice. The best artists, musicians, athletes, CEOs, and entrepreneurs don&rsquo;t merely work a lot, they work a lot on developing specific skills. For example, Jerry Seinfeld&rsquo;s <a href="https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy">&ldquo;don&rsquo;t break the chain&rdquo; strategy</a> is all about deliberately practicing the skill of writing jokes.</p>
<h2>Applying This to Your Life</h2>
<p>Mozart has been called the &ldquo;genius of geniuses&rdquo; and even he toiled away for 10 years before producing popular work. I don't know about you, but I find this inspiring.</p>
<p>I don't have the natural talent of Kobe Bryant or the sheer brilliance of Mozart, but I'm willing to put in my &ldquo;10 years of silence.&rdquo; I've only been writing on this site for 9 months, but I see this as the beginning of a 30&ndash;year project for me. And because I'm in this for good, I can win with commitment, grit, and unwavering consistency.</p>
<p>You can take the same approach to your work, to your goals, and to your legacy. By combining these two ideas &mdash; the consistency of &ldquo;10 years of silence&rdquo; and the focus of &ldquo;deliberate practice&rdquo; &mdash; you can blow past most people.</p>
<p>On a daily basis, this doesn't have to look big or impressive. And that's good, because it will often feel like you're failing. What feels like struggle and frustration is often skill development and growth. What looks like little pay and no recognition is often the price you have to pay to discover your best work. In other words, what looks like failure is often the foundation of success.</p>
<p>Thankfully, just one hour of focus and deliberate practice each day can deliver incredible results over the long&ndash;run. And that brings us to the most important questions of all:</p>
<p>Are you working toward your 10 years of silence today? Are you deliberately focused on developing your skills? Or are you simply &ldquo;putting in your time&rdquo; and hoping for the best?</p>

  </div></div></div><div><span><span>By </span></span></div></div></div></header><div><div><p>SANTA CLARITA, California&mdash;Cesar Millan crosses the road to meet me. Two pit bulls, a Chihuahua, and a Yorkshire terrier&mdash;named Junior, Taco, Alfie and Kaley Cuoko&mdash;follow. Off leash and at heel, the dogs are calm, almost languid. If Millan communicates with them, I do not notice.</p><p>For the past few minutes, I have been paying my respects to <a href="http://www.apple.com">Millan&rsquo;s pit bull, Daddy</a>. He died in 2010 and his simple grave marker depicts a sleeping dog and the words, &ldquo;Forever loved and missed,&rdquo; set among the rocks of Millan&rsquo;s training and rehabilitation clinic, dubbed the Dog Psychology Center. Millan sits in the spot where Daddy spent his final years, watching the wilderness of Santa Clarita&rsquo;s hill country, an hour north of Los Angeles. He tears up when he talks about his dog. &ldquo;This is a bed that I did for Daddy.&nbsp; He pretty much lived the rest of his years watching the llama and the horse. Nobody was allowed to be here except him. So we kept it this way. This is his place.&rdquo;</p><p>2010 was a terrible year for Cesar Millan. Besides Daddy&rsquo;s death, he went through a divorce and discovered he had no rights to the name, &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Whisperer_with_Cesar_Millan">Dog Whisperer,</a>&rdquo; the title of his&nbsp;television show on National Geographic Channel. He tried to kill himself by swallowing a bottle of Xanax. It was almost the end of an American dream for a man who grew up in Mexican drug country, and escaped when he was 21 by crawling through a tunnel in Tijuana with no money. He spoke no English and worked his way to Los Angeles by washing cars. He started a dog-walking business and scored a few celebrity clients. He landed a TV show, eventually becoming a celebrity himself as the world&rsquo;s most famous dog behaviorist. He churned out books, videos, even a magazine.</p><p>Then things fell apart.</p><p>His personal life was hardly the only source of trouble. The criticism of Millan&rsquo;s work has been steady and&nbsp;<a href="http://beyondcesarmillan.weebly.com/andrew-luescher.html">voluminous</a>. He was described on the<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/31/opinion/31derr.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;"> opinion pages of the New York Times</a> as a &ldquo;one-man wrecking ball directed at 40 years of progress in understanding and shaping dog behavior.&rdquo; At the core of the condemnation by dog trainers and experts is that Millan bullies, intimidates, and scares dogs into behaving, and&mdash;most controversially&mdash;uses a move called an &ldquo;alpha roll,&rdquo; where he forces a dog onto its back to make it submissive. Most of his opponents believe that positive reinforcement such as giving a dog praise and treats is both kinder and more effective. They say Millan&rsquo;s mistakes are grounded in a simplistic, out-of-date misunderstanding of animal science.</p><p>Who is right?</p><p>To answer that, we need history as well science. And a lot has changed for dogs recently&mdash;as well as in our understanding of them as a species. A century ago, there were about 1 million dogs in America, one for every hundred people. Fifty years ago, there were 30 million dogs, one for every six people. Today, there are 80 million dogs, one for every four people. Eight million (one in 10) of these animals are in shelters.</p><h2>A most unnatural selection: Dogs became our babies</h2><p>The role of dogs has changed, too. People have moved from rural lives to urban lives. A few decades ago, most dogs lived outside and were never allowed in the house. Today, the opposite is true. A hundred years ago, dogs worked as herders, hunters, or fighters. Today they are companions and family members.</p><p>The change in purpose has been matched by a change in perception. After Charles Darwin highlighted the power of selection in breeding, in 1859 with <em>The Origin of the Species</em>, his distant cousin Francis Galton popularized the idea of eugenics, or racial purity, in 1869, with a book called <em>Hereditary Intelligence</em>. Galton&rsquo;s misunderstanding of Darwin is a big reason the idea of &ldquo;purebred dogs&rdquo; emerged. Not coincidentally, the British Kennel Club was founded in 1873, and the American Kennel Club followed in 1884. Both organizations created registers of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; dogs, based on subjective judgments about appearance and performance, and established &ldquo;pedigree&rdquo; to manage breeding and genetic inheritance. Meanwhile, the idea of breeding pure people reached its gruesome peak under Hitler&rsquo;s reign&mdash;not coincidentally, the Nazis also led the world in purebred dogs. The German Shepherd, developed in 1899, was the official dog of the Third Reich. At the start of World War II, Hitler&rsquo;s army boasted 200,000 dogs. He owned three himself, the last of which was allowed to sleep in his bed&mdash;unlike his girlfriend, Eva Braun. After the war, &ldquo;pure breeds&rdquo; such as German Shepherds proliferated in Europe and America.</p><p>This matters because all the dogs in the world actually descended from a few gray wolves. And their evolution occurred relatively recently. While dogs lived with humans for tens of thousands of years, all these lines died out&mdash;except for one or two gray wolves in Asia. They made, according to <a href="https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/indivfaculty.php?FacultyKey=501">UCLA biologist Robert Wayne</a>, a &ldquo;profound adaptation&rdquo; by mutating to digest grain as well as meat. (This <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/science/how-dogs-adapted-our-starchy-diet-1C8086152">revelation was published earlier this year</a> by Swedish geneticist Erik Axelsson.) Wayne established that every dog&rsquo;s mitochondrial DNA is 99.9% the same as a gray wolf&rsquo;s&mdash;so close they are the same species. One-third of that 0.1% difference is in the genes for fat and carbohydrate digestion. Half is in the brain and the tiny remainder&mdash;so little it surprised even Wayne&mdash;controls the time and rate of physical development and accounts for the vast differences in size and shape between breeds. Basically, dogs are wolves that adapted to eat rice and be nice.</p><p>Both the transition from working outdoors to living indoors and the inbreeding of pure-blooded pedigrees&mdash;for example, all German Shepherds are descended from one dog that lived a hundred years ago&mdash;are highly unnatural. Today&rsquo;s dogs find themselves in an environment, and often a body, very different from they the one in which their species evolved. What is not unnatural for dogs is being with people. The difference in dog brains and wolf brains&mdash;half of that minuscule genetic difference&mdash;is a sophisticated interface for interacting with humans.</p><p>This too is a recent discovery. Only a few academic papers about dog behavior were published in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s, this number started to increase, and, by the turn of the century, it skyrocketed. One big reason was the opening of what was probably the world&rsquo;s first dog behavior lab at E&ouml;tv&ouml;s Lor&aacute;nd University in Budapest in 1994. Led by biologist &Aacute;d&aacute;m Mikl&oacute;si, the lab conducted sophisticated experiments with dogs and made a series of remarkable discoveries. Notably, dogs become attached to people. Wolves&mdash;even when raised as cubs in a home&mdash;do not.</p><figure><div><div>

  </div></div><div>Richard Schultz for Quartz</div></div><figcaption>Dogs look to humans for answers&mdash;and leadership.</figcaption></figure><p>This is true to an extraordinary extent. A dog put in a stressful situation will relax if a familiar human is there, but a familiar dog, even his mother, will make no difference. Dogs, even ones raised without human company, understand what it means when a person points, even if the pointing is done with a leg, and even if the object being pointed at it is far away. Dogs have an ability to read and interpret human faces that is unique among all animals. Their first instinct when faced with a problem is to look to a human for guidance, something wolves do not do. Dogs will also communicate by looking at a human, then at a target object, then back again. Wolves are not very vocal: they generally reserve howling and barking for long distance communication with out of sight animals. Dogs bark far more frequently than wolves. They do it to communicate aggressiveness, fear, despair, playfulness, and happiness. But, in most cases, dogs do not bark to communicate with each other, they bark to communicate with <i>us</i>.</p><h2>Dog needs man</h2><p>A dog, then, expects us to tell it what to do&mdash;to be what Cesar Millan calls a &ldquo;pack leader.&rdquo; This role (and the science behind it) is so important to him that his new TV show is called <em>Leader of the Pack</em>. The phrase is also the focus of a lot of the attacks on his methods. This is because, for a long time, scientists believed a wolf pack was a competition for hierarchical dominance between a breeding &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; pair and lower order &ldquo;beta&rdquo; and &ldquo;omega&rdquo; wolves. In the 1990s, wolf expert David Mech and others realized they had been wrong: this was only true of wolves that were not related to one another and were held in captivity. In the wild, a typical gray wolf pack is a family group consisting of a father, a mother, and several generations of siblings. &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; displaced &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; as the wolf expert&rsquo;s term of art.</p><p>Similarly, the word &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; appears to be becoming a thing of Millan&rsquo;s past. For example, it appeared in his first book four times: Not because he had learned about dogs from the old wolf theory&mdash;his understanding of dogs comes from experience and intuition and his rearing on a Mexican farm amid plenty of working dogs&mdash; but because it was a word some English speakers used when talking about dogs. He does not use it now. It does not appear at all in his latest book, and he did not use it once in the few hours we were together. As it fell out of favor among experts, he returned to the simpler word he has always preferred: &ldquo;leader.&rdquo;</p><p>Millan showed me what he means by &ldquo;leader&rdquo; as we walked around his property with Junior, Taco, Alfie, and Kaley Cuoko. &ldquo;Here we&rsquo;re going to have a chicken coop,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Inside we&rsquo;re going to build a little church. It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;The Little Brown Church,&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s where the chickens are going to go because they give life. I&rsquo;m going to open it so they can just mingle with the dogs everywhere. My job as a pack leader to give direction and protection. My direction will be: We don&rsquo;t kill chickens.&rdquo;</p><p>Most of this direction comes from presence and body language&mdash;what Millan, somewhat mystically, calls &ldquo;energy.&rdquo;</p><h2>We have five senses; they have a million</h2><p>There is no scientific mystery about how this works. The dog&rsquo;s dominant sense organ is its nose: smelling is to dogs what seeing is to us. Depending on breed, a dog gets up to 100 million times more information from scent that we do. We cannot easily conceive of all the things a dog learns about us through its nose. By smell alone a dog can tell, among many other things, whether or not we have malignant melanoma, bladder, breast, ovarian, prostate or lung cancer, long before any medical tests. Our scent goes with us everywhere: we are constantly shedding microscopic particles of dead skin that weigh 200-millionths of an ounce and are shaped like cornflakes. Each particle is laden with a unique scent&mdash;from our skin, from the four bacteria each one typically carries, from our bodily secretions and from vapors that surround us. These scent-carrying particles do not fall to the ground. They fly up, carried by air currents surrounding our bodies at 125-feet-a-second&mdash;even faster in hot weather or if we are wearing certain clothes. They change direction depending on how we move and eventually disperse 18 inches about our head. They broadcast our unique smell for many hours. Once emitted they decay, signaling time like a ticking clock.</p><p>Dogs can smell things that are far away and, because of their wet nose, detect the direction it is coming from. They can smell what has happened in the recent past. Most importantly, because of the chemical changes emotions cause and the way air flows around our body when we move, they can smell how we feel. In short, when a person has what Millan calls &ldquo;calm assertive energy,&rdquo; dogs can smell it. They can also smell fear, nervousness, sadness, and stress. They can see it too.</p><p>A dog&rsquo;s vision is as different from ours as its sense of smell. Among other things, dogs have up to 270 degrees of peripheral vision. They can see us from over their shoulders without turning their head. Pretty much the last thing a dog does is listen. Millan: &ldquo;Scent before sight before sound.&rdquo;</p><p>Dogs that are already calm and paying attention can understand words they have learned in context&mdash;more than a thousand in <a href="https://umdrive.memphis.edu/ogriebel@UofM/public/CogScieSeminar%20Evolution%20of%20Communication/Reading%20assignments/Andrew%20Olney%2019th%20Sept/Pilley%20and%20Reid%202011.pdf">at least one case</a>&mdash;but verbal commands are unlikely to be effective otherwise. They will almost never work, even in obedient dogs, if the dog cannot see the face of the person talking. This is really easy to prove. When your dog is calm and relaxed, look into her eyes and tell her to &ldquo;sit.&rdquo; She will probably sit. Wait until she gets up. Turn your back to her and say &ldquo;sit.&rdquo; She almost certainly won&rsquo;t. To put it another way, yelling at your dog makes no sense.</p><p>This is why Millan, despite being the &ldquo;dog whisperer,&rdquo; seldom talks to dogs. The closest he comes is an occasional clipped hiss&mdash;it sounds like &ldquo;sssssst!&rdquo;&mdash;to get their attention. Taco starts chewing on a plastic fork. &ldquo;Ssssst!&rdquo; says Millan. Taco looks at Millan for leadership. Millan gently removes the fork and resumes the conversation.</p><h2>Wolves have each other, but dogs just have you</h2><p>Our understanding of wolves was <i>not</i> overturned by the realization that wild packs are families. What we learned was that there were <i>two</i> models of social behavior: one for captive, unrelated wolves, and another for wild, related, wolves. One is more aggressive, and the other is more cooperative, but both are still hierarchical. Anyone who thinks there is no pecking order in a family has never been in a family.</p><p>The question at the center of the Cesar Millan controversy&mdash;and at the heart of understanding dog behavior in general&mdash;is which model applies to dogs? How best to train them? Their natural social group is humans, not related dogs, and even if they are with relatives, the lab in Budapest has shown that, once dogs are a few months old, they are almost completely indifferent to other family members. And their modern environment is inside a house. Is that like being in captivity, or like being in the wild?</p><p>For his part, Millan does not address his critics and cautions that there are many ways to train dogs. But the answer to this question is clear: People are the boss. Millan&rsquo;s methods only have been bolstered by the spate of research on dogs and wolves. A dog&rsquo;s pack, or family, is a unique interspecies group that must include people and may include other dogs. <strong>And a dog&rsquo;s first instinct&mdash;unlike a wolf&rsquo;s&mdash;is to look to the people for leadership. Only when it does not find that, either because its human is too abusive, affectionate, or unstable, does it start to behave more like a captive wolf with no family&mdash;aggressively questing for dominance, out of insecurity more than anything else. All along, this has been Millan&rsquo;s secret to well-behaved dogs.</strong></p><h2>What humans are doing to dogs</h2><p>This aggressive questing is more likely today, because we keep dogs indoors and may treat them like friends or infants, rather than giving them the reassurance that they are safe because we are in charge. Even when we do provide leadership, our dogs will organize themselves hierarchically. The process is normally peaceful, but sometimes there is a little nipping and growling. Wolves, and therefore dogs, test each other&mdash;and us&mdash;to see who should be pack leader. This is essential, evolved behavior: just as the strength of the wolf is the pack, so the strength of the pack is the leader. Anybody with more than one dog knows they sort themselves into an order, not a group of equals, typically with tests of dominance exactly the same as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv7LCgW6gVM">the ones wolves use in the wild</a>. Millan&rsquo;s explanation on how this plays out:</p><blockquote><p>There are three positions: the back, the middle and the front. The guys in the back are the most timid ones. At the same time they are very sensitive, so they&rsquo;re going to alert you for everything. If you want somebody to tell you when an earthquake is coming, that&rsquo;s that guy. You don&rsquo;t expect the rest of the guys to be as sensitive. Everybody in the pack is just as valuable. The guys in the front, those are the police dogs. They&rsquo;re constantly at alert. And then the happy-go-lucky guys are in the middle.&nbsp; These are the guys that make sure the guys in the front and the guys in the back co-exist.</p></blockquote><p>When he says this, he mimics body language for three positions: looking around timidly as the dog at the back (where Kaley Cuoco lives), thrusting forward assertively as the dog at the front (like Junior), pimp-rolling as the dog in the middle (like Taco). Millan has dog body language down cold. He does not just copy it, he reads it.</p><figure><div><div>

  </div></div><div>Scott Grover for Quartz</div></div><figcaption>No need to whisper: Cesar Millan is the leader of the pack.</figcaption></figure><p>He is so good at it that if you slow down his TV shows, you will frequently see Millan reacting to what a dog does before the dog does it. He will reach for a dog&rsquo;s collar frames before it lunges. He will start to correct a dog a fraction of a second before it misbehaves. He can read a dog as if he himself is a dog.</p><p>This also debunks the argument that Millan is out of touch and that positive reinforcement is the new, better way. The truth is the opposite. What dog trainers call &ldquo;positive reinforcement&rdquo; is an example of something called &ldquo;<a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/behavioralpsychology/a/introopcond.htm">operant conditioning</a>,&rdquo; a method of learning that relies on reward or punishment. One of positive reinforcement&rsquo;s earliest incarnations was &ldquo;clicker training,&rdquo; developed <a href="http://www.behavior1.com/page8.html">by Marian Kruse and Keller Breland in </a><a href="http://www.behavior1.com/page8.html">the 1940s</a>. In clicker training, a dog or any other animal&mdash;Kruse and Breland used the technique with more than a hundred species including bears, chickens, and humans&mdash;is given a reward and hears the sound of a click whenever it does something the trainer wants it to repeat. In time, the treat is eliminated leaving only the click, and eventually the click can be removed too, leaving only the training. Kruse and Keller were students of B.F. Skinner, who, along with Ivan Pavlov of <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/classicalconditioning/a/pavlovs-dogs.htm">salivating dogs fame</a>, was a founder of the school of psychology called &ldquo;behaviorism.&rdquo; In Skinner&rsquo;s view, living things, including humans, were &ldquo;organisms&rdquo; that do what they do merely as a result of response to stimulus. It was not necessary to understand their goals or motives&mdash;only to condition them to provide the desired response on command. This approach shaped dog training for decades.</p><h2>An obedient dog is not always a happy one</h2><p>When dogs first became urban pets instead of rural hunters and herders, the first wave of dog trainers, influenced by Skinner, Pavlov and others, taught dogs to perform tricks like &ldquo;sit&rdquo; and &ldquo;roll-over&rdquo; by using command-based conditioning. The goal was not happiness but obedience. Behaviorism, like breed purity, dates back to the late 19th century. By the end of the 20th century, it had been displaced by a more complete, humane understanding of what living creatures do and why, called &ldquo;cognitive psychology.&rdquo; Cognitive psychology treats people and animals as complicated, sentient thinkers, with behaviors that result from instinct, intuition and reason, and are often directed by goals. Behaviorists train dogs to be obedient. Cognitivists lead dogs to be happy. Millan is in this latter category, the ultimate dog cognitivist. He seeks to understand what dogs need and think and why. He is not behind the times, but way ahead of them. It is the positive reinforcers who are out of date.</p><p>Now, three years after he tried to kill himself, Millan is rebuilding. He is in a serious relationship, has a new TV show, and a new dog psychology center, where he is getting back to his roots by recreating his grandfather&rsquo;s farm in Mexico&mdash;a humble place with livestock and adobe that is about as far from Hollywood as it could be, permanently occupied by the immortal spirit of his favorite dog, Daddy. Of the vital function that dogs perform, Eckhart Tolle says:</p><blockquote><p>They keep millions of people sane. They have become guardians of being.</p></blockquote><p>Tolle is a spiritualist, but his observation is more than mystical. It is supported by&nbsp;<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1997-36468-001">science</a>. The findings are not as simple as dogs improving human life. It depends on the dog, and most of all, it depends on you But for all the proof that dogs need humans, a fairly consistent body of research does show benefits of the reverse. People with dogs feel&nbsp;<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/61/4/582/">more relaxed</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://jah.sagepub.com/content/20/4/437.short">less lonely,</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829206000062">exercise more</a>, and are even&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.medicine.wisc.edu/home/files/Bufford%20et%20al%20Clin%20Exp%20All%202008.pdf">less likely to have infants with allergies</a>. Some of the biggest impacts of dog ownership are felt by two types of people in particular: women and single men. A single man with a dog is much less likely to suffer from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00224540903368533">depression</a>&nbsp;than a single man without one.</p><p><em>This article is part of&nbsp;<a href="https://qz.com/re/ideas/">Quartz Ideas</a>, our home for bold arguments and big thinkers.</em></p></div><aside></aside></div></div><style>

  </div><div><h2>The 1994 World Cup changed soccer in America forever. The men from the U.S. team remember how it all happened.</h2><div>

  <div>
    <p><i>On July 4, 1988, FIFA awarded the 1994 World Cup to the United States. At the time, there was no top-flight professional league in the U.S., and it had been 38 years since the country had participated in a World Cup. As a condition for awarding the tournament, FIFA required the United States to create a new professional league.</i></p>
    <p><i>A year and a half later, Paul Caligiuri scored one of the most important goals in American soccer history. His strike against Trinidad and Tobago qualified the U.S. for the 1990 World Cup &mdash; the team's first since 1950. Although under manager Bob Gansler the Americans lost all three World Cup games in Italy that summer, falling to Czechoslovakia, the Italians and Austria, the modern era of American soccer had begun.</i></p>

    <div>
      <p><q>The modern era of American soccer had begun.</q></p>
    </div>

    <p><i>Two months after the 1990 World Cup, United States Soccer Federation president Werner Fricker was up for reelection. Although Fricker had helped the U.S. secure the 1994 World Cup, he was ousted and replaced by Alan Rothenberg, a former investor in the North American Soccer League and overseer of the wildly successful 1984 Olympic soccer tournament in Los Angeles.</i></p>
    <p><i>One of Rothenberg's first moves as president was to name Bora Milutinovic head coach of the national team. The Serbian coached Mexico to the 1986 World Cup quarterfinal and, even more impressively, led Costa Rica to the 1990 World Cup round of 16 after being hired as head coach just 90 days before the tournament.</i></p>
    <p><i>As the host country, the U.S. did not have to qualify for the tournament. Because most American players had few professional options, Milutinovic had most of his players in a permanent national team camp in Mission Viejo, Calif., for two years leading up to the World Cup.</i></p>

    <p><b>ALAN ROTHENBERG, USSF president:</b> The U.S. in 1990, it was almost a surprise that they qualified. It was really a bunch of college kids and a coach from a college program, and they were kind of overwhelmed with the step up. We were then handicapped as we prepared for 1994, because the world didn't have any respect for any of our players and virtually none of them could get jobs overseas.</p>

    <p><b>ALEXI LALAS, defender:</b> It was such a unique experience and unlike anything that has been done since or is done today. The majority of the team was in camp for basically two years leading up to the World Cup. Guys like myself and Cobi Jones, when we stepped on the field that summer, we had never even been on the books of any professional club team. We had only played international soccer so it was a very backwards way of doing things, but a necessity at the time.</p>

    <p><b>BORA MILUTINOVIC, head coach:</b> I think it was very important to have everyone on the same page, the coaching staff, people who worked in Mission Viejo, we decided to be there at this time. We didn't have a league, we didn't have anything.</p>
    <div><span>

                </div> </span></div>

    <p><b>LALAS:</b> If you ask any national team coach today, the biggest frustration is that they don't get enough time with the players. I think Bora saw a unique opportunity to have the core of this team basically function as a club team &mdash; living and working together on a daily basis. And so all we did was tour around and play international games and just train in Mission Viejo.</p>

    <p><b>PAUL CALIGIURI, defender:</b> U.S. Soccer and Bora did a good job of bringing in a lot of players into the process, but at the same time keeping the core players together to create the continuity that was needed.</p>

    <p><b>MARCELO BALBOA, defender</b>: For most of us, that's all we had. A lot of us were not playing professional soccer in Europe at the time, so this was basically our professional team.</p>

    <div>
      <p><q>We trained twice a day, morning and afternoon, and then the federation would try to get as many friendlies as possible.</q></p>
    </div>

    <p><b>LALAS:</b> We were on monthly contracts, so you could get fired at any time, and they paid for your apartment and you got some stipend or whatever it was. We weren't making that much money, but that was fine by me.</p>

    <p><b>MIKE SORBER, midfielder: </b>We trained twice a day, morning and afternoon, and then the federation would try to get as many friendlies as possible. It was all geared toward getting us prepared for competing against the best teams in the world.</p>

    <p><b>TONY MEOLA, goalkeeper:</b> I don't know the number of teams we played in that year-and-a-half, but it sure was a lot, it sure was a lot of traveling. I think that year, 1993, we were on the road over 250 days that year with Bora.</p>

    <p><i>In 1993, the USA played 29 official international matches, which took place in the United States as well as Japan, El Salvador, Honduras, Saudi Arabia, Ecuador, Mexico, Iceland and Norway. The team would play an additional 15 friendlies in the first five months of 1994 leading into the World Cup.</i></p>
    <p><i>Three weeks before the tournament, the U.S. brought in seven foreign-based players to add to the group in Mission Viejo: John Harkes (Derby County), Tab Ramos (Real Betis), Cle Kooiman (Cruz Azul), Earnie Stewart (Willem II), Roy Wegerle (Coventry City), J&uuml;rgen Sommer (Luton Town), and Eric Wynalda (FC Saarbr&uuml;cken).</i></p>

    <p><b>TAB RAMOS, midfielder:</b> The guys that came in right at the end in the last three weeks, we weren't used to the trainings, we weren't used to the daily routine that all the other guys were used to, because basically the guys were all living there as if they were playing for a professional club, and then all of a sudden we come in.</p>

    <p><b>ERIC WYNALDA, forward:</b> That was a hard time because Bora had to make the final cuts, and Jeff Agoos and Chris Henderson and Dominic Kinnear were the last three, and that was rough because we were coming in and they were saying their goodbyes. They had worked so hard and they just didn't make the team and that was a rough couple of days.</p>

    <p><i>As Milutinovic and his team prepared on the field, the USSF, led by Rothenberg, was working to ensure the tournament would be the cultural and financial success that the nascent American soccer landscape desperately needed.</i></p>

    <div>
      <p><q>We came up with a mission statement and it was pretty bold, because we said we want to put on the greatest World Cup in history.</q></p>
    </div>

    <p><b>ROTHENBERG:</b> Early on, we had a small group of executives at a retreat and we came up with a mission statement and it was pretty bold, because we said we want to put on the greatest World Cup in history. We added to the mission statement that we would leave a legacy for soccer in the United States and so at all times, we were trying to put on a phenomenal event that would be well received, but also use that to really create a lasting interest in soccer and to grow the sport.</p>

    <p><b>JOHN HARKES, midfielder:</b> As we know from history, the U.S. fans love events, and this was one that was going to be well attended. As it went through the tournament it built up momentum, and the energy was there and certainly the sponsors and the business side of things started to pick up.</p>

    <p><b>ROTHENBERG:</b> Any time we had an announcement of any kind, we made a big press conference out of it. Instead of just quietly having one announcement that said we're oversold, we did one after each day: New York just sold out, D.C. just sold out, Boston just sold out, and so there was a big story every day. The whole idea was to create in the public's mind that this was a hot ticket. Any time a new sponsor was added, we didn't just send out a press release, we made a big hoopla, we'd have a press conference.</p>

    <p><b>MEOLA: </b>All the sponsors were doing things in Mission Viejo because that's where the team was. A few of us filmed a MasterCard video that took a whole bunch of days after training.</p>

    <p><b>CALIGIURI: </b>One of the benefits of having the World Cup Committee based in Century City and having us in Mission Viejo was for the organization to have access to players to do either appearances or television interviews. That was key. The American public was beginning to buy what the World Cup was about and to identify with players.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA: </b>All of Alan Rothenberg's hard work went into it, because it really was his baby.</p>

    <p><b>ROTHENBERG: </b>We used every opportunity we could to create that hype. I remember at the final &mdash; it was Jim Gray at ESPN &mdash; he said to me, "Alan, let me ask you this, do you think all the hype was necessary? Did you know it would be a great event?" I said I was sure it would be a great event. I didn't know whether the hype was necessary, but I didn't want to take any chances.</p>

    <p><i>Despite being a seeded team as the host, the USA was drawn into a very difficult Group A.</i></p>

    <p><b>ROTHENBERG: </b>Going into the tournament, Colombia was considered to be a really good dark horse to win it all. So the one team that we didn't want to get thrown into our group was Colombia, and lo and behold, our group turns out to be Colombia, Romania, and Switzerland. So we said, "We can beat Switzerland, we can sneak a tie from Romania and then we'll lose to Colombia and we'll sneak through and play past the group stage."</p>

    <p><i>The U.S. was set to face Switzerland in both teams' World Cup opener on June 18. The game, played at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., outside Detroit, would be the first-ever indoor World Cup match.</i></p>

    <p><b>BALBOA: </b>The night before Bora took us to the stadium with the lights off, and played a video for us in the stadium. We all kind of held hands and watched from one goal line to the halfway line.</p>

    <p><b>MILUTINOVC: </b>Normally the night before, you talk about the game tomorrow, but we had a great motivational movie about how we performed before. It was an 11-minute movie and we speak nothing about the game.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA</b>: I remember the video, I remember the song: "Right Now" by Van Halen. I didn't get it at first and then it was very cool. He had spent a lot of time editing just good thoughts to take into that game. I think we all were still trying to figure out a way to get a copy of that damn thing for the longest time.</p>

    <p><b>HARKES: </b>It was a little surreal. I think he kind of tried to grasp what was the best way to get us to be excited, and have this pumped up type of enthusiasm and positive feelings about ourselves, so it was great that he had put that together. The music choice? Well, we can always question that, but it was fun.</p>

    <p><b>SIGI SCHMID, assistant coach: </b>Bora was really insistent when he did those videos of making sure everybody's name appeared in the video at some point. It was like a subliminal type of thing. Then everybody's picture and them playing in action was in the video. He wanted everything to be hit three times, between your picture, you playing in action and your name.</p>

    <p><b>CALIGIURI: </b>The benefit I saw was we were able to go on the field. For me it was trying to visualize the atmosphere, what the stadium looked like, the sidelines, the width of the field, the dimensions, the texture, the grass.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA:</b> I found out we were going to the stadium, and it wasn't to practice, but I asked one of the kids that was with us, like kind of our ball boy ... I said, "Hey bring my shoes and a bag of balls because I want to practice free kicks." And so I actually stayed that night and hit a few, totally and completely against Bora's wishes. I only hit like 10 or 11, but I figured out that the ball would carry a little bit more than it would maybe in an outdoor facility.</p>
  </div>
  <div>

  </div>
  <div>

    <p><b>LALAS: </b>Somebody recently told me that Dr. Henry Kissinger was in the locker room before the game and I had completely blanked that out. I never remembered that, and once I was reminded of it I said, "Oh, my gosh, it's true." I only say that to illustrate that it was surreal.</p>

    <p><b>MEOLA: </b>I still have that picture hanging up. He had been such an advocate for the World Cup. He was one of those guys who really stuck his neck out for the World Cup. He was a real ambassador, as was President Clinton, as was Al Gore.</p>

    <div>
      <p><q>It was the worst place I have ever played.</q></p>
    </div>

    <p><b>CALIGIURI: </b>It was a very hot summer and Detroit was extremely humid. The Silverdome was built for turf, they brought grass in these big octagons and they had to water it. It added to the humidity and the texture of the grass, it was too soft. That was by far one of the most difficult conditions to play in in my life. The combination of hot weather &mdash; 90 degrees with 90-percent humidity in an unventilated dome with grass that shouldn't be there that was watered, it made for severe conditions.</p>

    <p><b>THOMAS DOOLEY, midfielder:</b> It was the worst place I have ever played. I can't say the hottest, but for sure the most humid.</p>

    <p><b>RAMOS: </b>It was probably the hottest game that I have been involved in. I know what it's like to play in Dallas at 4 p.m. in an MLS game, and that does not compare to how hot that game was inside the Silverdome. The field felt like we were running in sand, it was very heavy, it was just a very, very difficult match environment to play in.</p>

    <p><b>LALAS:</b> We knew that if we had a chance to come out of the group, we needed to get points against Switzerland.</p>

    <p><b>SORBER: </b>Switzerland was a good, solid opponent, just like they are today. From an American perspective or from the media perspective, they don't necessarily have a ton of flavor or flair, but they had really good players.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA: </b>Switzerland was a very good team. Just because not everybody knew who (Ciriaco) Sforza and (Alain) Sutter and all those guys were, we did. I knew their whole team, (St&eacute;phane) Chapuisat was a fantastic player. They were very hard to break down, they were very difficult defensively and we really struggled with that.</p>

    <p><b>BALBOA:</b> It was one of those games, back and forth, back and forth. I have to say, it was not pretty soccer if you remember looking at that game, it was some pretty negative soccer.</p>

    <p><i>In the 39th minute, Switzerland won a free kick just outside of the U.S. 18-yard box. Georges Bregy stepped up and curled a shot inside the far post to give his side a 1-0 lead. Five minutes later, just before the halftime whistle, the Americans got a free kick opportunity of their own from 30 yards away.</i></p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA:</b> I knew there was going to be a fight for it, because everybody wants to hit free kicks. I just blocked everybody out, I put the ball down and I went into a zone. I wasn't even going to listen to anybody that tried to talk me out of taking that, and they all laugh about it, but I literally was just unresponsive to anything. They were saying, "I'll take it" or "Tap it to me and I'll hit it" and Marcelo had an idea. I just didn't listen to any of them. I just was really pushing everybody out of the way. I really wanted to take advantage of what I had learned from the night before. I knew I had to take a golf swing and not hit it too hard. I think that was the first time I ever hit a free kick that went exactly where it was supposed to, so good timing.</p>

    <p><b>MILUTINOVIC: </b>Wynalda scored a beautiful goal. It's very simple I think, when you have players with confidence and the right mentality, the right team spirit, everything is much easier.</p>

    <p><b>BALBOA: </b>You never want to go into a second half chasing a game, you never want to go into the last 20 minutes chasing a game, so getting a goal that got us back into the game is what we wanted.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA:</b> We did have a couple of chances in the second half. We were the better team in the second half.</p>

    <p><b>MILUTINOVIC: </b>This one point was very important. Switzerland was a very good team and for us, the way that we played was good, and it was very important to give hope to people for the future.</p>

    <p><b>EARNIE STEWART, forward:</b> Once you go 1-0 behind and you have to chase the game in the heat and humidity, it made it very difficult. We were satisfied after the game with the 1-1 result because Eric put in a fantastic free kick.</p>

    <p><b>HARKES: </b>We were a bit unlucky at times I think not to win that game but more importantly, getting a tie against Switzerland kind of set us up for the next game, which really then instilled a bigger belief in ourselves of what we were capable of at this level.</p>

    <p><b>BALBOA:</b> We knew we had to get a result against Switzerland, because we knew we had Colombia next and nobody gave us a chance against Colombia.</p>


  </div>
  <div>

  </div>
  <div>
    <p><b>BALBOA: </b>We played Colombia probably six or seven times in the two to three years leading up to that World Cup and we never beat them. Everybody thought that Colombia had a bad game against Romania and was going to come back and take it out on the United States. (Romania defeated Colombia, 3-1)</p>

    <p><b>RAMOS:</b> They had lost their first game, so we knew they were under a lot of pressure because they needed to win the game against us. I don't think a tie even helped them much, they just needed the three points.</p>

    <div>
      <p><q>I told them, "Now is the moment."</q></p>
    </div>

    <p><b>MILUTINOVIC:</b> We played many friendly games against Colombia, and we would lose 1-0, 2-1, but in every game we have a chance to win. I told them, "Now is the moment." It was important that we played with confidence.</p>

    <p><b>SCHMID:</b> I think Colombia was the game we were most prepared for. Bora knew Colombia inside and out. Colombia was the game he was focused on because he felt that their playing style was very unique, that we could play a little bit different and we could push our outside backs inside because they really didn't play with a lot of width. So his game plan was very clear in his mind and was very predetermined. Of all the games in the World Cup, that was the game that was the game that Bora was most confident in from the standpoint of the game plan.</p>

    <p><b>CALIGIURI:</b> Our tactic was to channel them inside. We practiced so much on that day in and day out. The one thing we wanted to eliminate was them exposing us on the outside and channeling their play into our numbers. We prepared ourselves well for that and we kept the ball in front of us.</p>

    <p><b>SORBER: </b>Colombia was limited because they just had a short passing game, which played into our hands. We were smart enough to figure that out.</p>

    <p><i>The U.S. started the match on the back foot, and just six minutes into the match, Colombia had a gilt-edged chance to score.</i></p>

    <p><b>BALBOA:</b> Let's be honest, if Sorber and Clavijo don't save the ball off the line and they go up 1-0 on us in the first five minutes of the game, it probably would have been a different outcome. That play changed the momentum of that game.</p>

    <p><b>SORBER: </b>It was a restart that came in. The cross just kind of handcuffed me right at my hips, so all I could do rather than knock it in the goal was try to get a piece of it with my legs. Still, I couldn't get it wide and it hit the post, and then when I turned it was coming right to a Colombian, so I went to the ground to block it and got a piece of that. Then Clavijo came flying back in across the line and cleared it out.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA:</b> It was Mike Sorber and Fernando Clavijo that saved us in the opening minutes, but once that chance didn't go in for them and the own goal happened, the game just changed.</p>

    <p><b>HARKES:</b> They gave the ball away at midfield and Mike Sorber hooked one out for me. I just took a touch down into space on the outside and ended up cutting in a bit and cracked one as hard as I could. I saw Earnie Stewart making a sprint run into the box on the backside and with Earnie's pace I thought, &lsquo;If I nail this as hard as I can, he might just get a touch on the end of it.'</p>

    <p><b>STEWART: </b>You just make your run to the far post, and it was a good cross where somebody has to reach for the ball, otherwise it would have come to my feet.</p>

    <p><b>HARKES: </b>It ended up just coming off of Andres Escobar as he tried to reach for it and clear it out of the 18. Their goalkeeper was wrong-footed and it ended up being an own goal.</p>

                </div></span></div>

    <p><b>STEWART:</b> It was an unlucky goal for Escobar, but at that time you're just happy that a ball goes into the back of the net and you're leading that game.</p>

    <p><i>The U.S. went into halftime with a surprising 1-0 lead. As the second half began, Milutinovic's side pressed for a second goal. Seven minutes into the half, it arrived.</i></p>

    <p><b>RAMOS:</b> I remember receiving the ball and hitting a through pass to Earnie Stewart on a run between a couple of defenders.</p>

    <p><b>STEWART: </b>As a center forward you try to make your runs in between narrow spots and try to receive the ball and be available for your teammates. You need somebody behind the ball that can play the ball and Tab is one of those players that can always do that at the right time.</p>

    <div>
      <p><q>That's a world-class goal. That's Spain or Brazil written all over it.</q></p>
    </div>

    <p><b>RAMOS:</b> As I was hitting the ball I wasn't sure whether to put it between the defenders or to hit Earnie hard to feet. I ended up going into space behind the last defender and it just happened to end up almost in a perfect place so that Earnie could run onto it and get a toe on it as the goalkeeper was coming out.</p>

    <p><b>STEWART:</b> It was a fantastic through pass for me and in the end I was fortunate enough where it hit the goalie, it hit the post and it went into the back of the net. It was an unbelievable and indescribable moment.</p>

    <p><b>SORBER:</b> The build up to that second goal is phenomenal, because it starts in the other end pretty much at our corner flag. That's a world-class goal. That's Spain or Brazil written all over it. People only look at the goal, but go back and look at the whole build up. And that speaks about the quality of our team.</p>

    <p><b>BALBOA: </b>When we weathered the storm, and the storm blew by and the clouds opened up and we saw the sun, you realized that it was our day. Let's be honest, we were not that kind of confident, there's no way in hell I would have tried a bicycle kick.</p>

    <p><b>LALAS: </b>Marcelo Balboa has the ultimate "what if" with that bike.</p>

    <p><b>BALBOA:</b> I am 46 years old and I still have people come up to me and tell me that they were behind that goal when I missed that bicycle kick. So it's kind of cool, I don't get the best goal ever, but I get the best miss ever, so that's kind of an honor to have, right?</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA:</b> There were some amazing performances that day. Caligiuri, Alexi and Marcelo and Tom Dooley and Clavijo, they were just unbelievable. The back five if you will, if you count Dooley and how many times he would get a slide tackle or just a toe in. And then in the second half, Mike Sorber played out of his mind.</p>

    <p><b>MILUTINOVIC: </b>For us, it was a perfect game.</p>


    <p><b>DOOLEY: </b>I was not surprised. We believed in ourselves and we were a real team. Everybody helped everybody, we played for each other, and with each other. It was a perfect fit.</p>

    <p><b>LALAS: </b>We all had that moment that kids dream about that you see with the flags and holding it up and screaming and yelling. When it finally happens, it's very surreal because there's no soundtrack. I just remember thinking "There's no music right now. It feels wonderful but there's no music."</p>

    <p><b>MEOLA:</b> One of the pictures that's always in my mind is John Harkes and I with the American flag and Thomas Dooley jumping on our back. None of that stuff is rehearsed, running around the field, waving the American flag, you don't really rehearse that stuff.</p>

    <p><b>SCHMID: </b>The euphoria of the Colombia game was fantastic because that was the crowning achievement in group play. It was winning a game in the World Cup, knocking off a team that Pele had thought would be one of the favorites to get to the final, all of those things were ever present in that situation. You can't truly measure the impact that win had on those players, but also on the sport of soccer in this country. It was like the final proving ground of "Yes, we can do it."</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <p><q>When you're expected to do something, then it's a little different.</q></p>
    </div>

    <p><b>RAMOS: </b>It was a very tough game for us, because now it was almost like we had arrived. Here we are, we have four points and leading our group going into that game. As Americans, you get to the point, especially in the soccer world, where you're used to being the underdog all the time, and it's easy to compete as the underdog. No one expects anything from you and you just go and do the best you can and at the end everyone pats you on the back and you go home win or lose. And now, when you're expected to do something, then it's a little different.</p>

    <p><b>LALAS:</b> We hadn't planned on getting three points against Colombia and therefore our performance against Romania was reflective of the fact that we kind of got it before, we thought we were going to get it. We thought it was going to take those three games to get the four points.</p>

    <p><b>BALBOA:</b> It was a letdown performance. Let's just be straight up and honest. Once we beat Colombia and we had the four points, we knew we were in the second round.</p>

    <p><b>DOOLEY: </b>Romania was a good technical team with experienced players. It is not easy to beat those European teams. They're technically good, tactically very organized, and individually great players.</p>

    <p><b>CALIGIURI: </b>Romania was the country we least prepared for and for me, it was the best team in terms of their ability, their individuality with (Gheorghe) Hagi, and players that were dynamic coming out of the back, and we weren't prepared for them at all.</p>

    <p><b>ROTHENBERG:</b> I still see that near post goal against Tony that broke our hearts against Romania.</p>

    <p><b>MEOLA:</b> I gave up a goal where I was cheating out for the cross and he went near post on me. I look at it and we went down 1-0.</p>

    <p><b>LALAS:</b> People ask me about that all the time and I don't like to stand up for goalkeepers a lot, but on this one I will, because I tell people all the time, they say "Tony was cheating the cross," and I say, "Yeah, but you know what? The amount of times that Tony Meola saved our ass because he did that ..." I have no problem with that goal.</p>

    <p><b>MEOLA:</b> I did it before that, I did it after that. I continued to do it. A couple times along the way I got burned, but I'm sure there were hundreds of times where I cut balls off across the box that maybe would have gotten to somebody in a more dangerous position. It was just the way I played.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA:</b> You'd have to ask the goal scorer what he was thinking, but you have to calculate in there that usually they lie, because as a goal scorer I will tell you sometimes when I get lucky that I meant it.</p>

    <p><b>BALBOA: </b>And then Harkes gets a second yellow card and he's out for the next game.</p>

    <p><b>HARKES:</b> The phantom encroachment. There was no encroachment from us at all. It was kind of a strange call because Hagi, who was taking the free kick at the time, was complaining feverishly and the referee thought he was complaining about us stepping forward in the wall, which we weren't. He was complaining that none of his players were in the box. It was a tough one, but at the end of the day, I felt a little bit burned because Mike Sorber at the time was standing in the wall with me &mdash; he didn't get booked and I did, I think because I was the closest to the referee. So the referee was feeling whatever pressure he felt and did it. It was unfortunate.</p>

    <p><b>MEOLA:</b> The referee could have given it to two or three guys. He picked John and for that, John was out of the next game. Just kind of bad luck on our part.</p>

    <p><b>MILUTINOVIC: </b>Our team always played to win and we gave up one goal early. But what is important is that our team showed great personality. We played good, we created chances, we didn't score and they scored. But this didn't change my impression of what my team could do.</p>

    <h4>Final: USA 0, Romania 1</h4>
    <div></div>
    <p><i>Following the loss to Romania, the USA faced a nervous two-day wait to find out if it had advanced to the round of 16. Eventually, Milutinovic's men learned they had qualified by virtue of being one of the top four third-place finishers, joining the top two from each of the six groups. The team's reward was a Fourth of July showdown with Brazil &mdash; the tournament favorite.</i></p>

    <p><b>BALBOA: </b>The truth was "Ah shit, Brazil!?"</p>

    <p><b>RAMOS: </b>It was obviously unfortunate for us that we drew Brazil, because if we could have gotten a better result against Romania, we could've drawn another team.</p>

    <p><b>CALIGIURI: </b>Had we drawn against Romania, we would have been playing Argentina at the Rose Bowl on July 3rd, not Brazil at Stanford on July 4th. And the difference between that was huge. Brazil was by far the strongest team.</p>

    <div>
      <p><q>We had the belief that somehow we could pull this out.</q></p>
    </div>

    <p><b>MEOLA: </b>We had played Brazil the year earlier and we had lost 2-0 in Connecticut, and they had a full squad there. We came out of that game thinking, &lsquo;We can have a run at these guys.'</p>

    <p><b>STEWART: </b>As an athlete and certainly as an American athlete you always believe you can win games, so even when the draw came against Brazil, we had the belief that somehow we could pull this out.</p>

    <p><i>As the team was preparing for Brazil, horrific news emerged from Colombia. On July 2 &mdash; just six days after Colombia had exited the tournament at the group stage &mdash; Andres Escobar was murdered in Medellin. The details around his killing are vague, but the gunmen allegedly made references to the own goal Escobar scored against the USA before, during, and after the murder. It would also later emerge that members of the Colombia team and coaching staff, and their families, were subject to death threats from cartel members during the tournament.</i></p>

    <p><b>MEOLA: </b>Bora made the announcement to us in the morning meeting what had happened and then it was like complete shock. When I think about it, I still get a sick feeling in my stomach and I always wonder how difficult it was for Colombia to go through that period.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA: </b>All that stuff that they were going through, we didn't know about, but it came out later that, obviously, that was a big part of their psyche.</p>

    <p><b>BALBOA: </b>I think most of us really found out the truth when that "30 for 30" special came out on ESPN ("The Two Escobars.") I think that's when the whole world realized the pressure the Colombians were under. I think we knew there were some things, we heard some rumors of guys' houses being burned down, but the magnitude of what that "30 for 30" special showed, I would say none of us had a clue of what was going on and the pressure those guys had in Colombia.</p>

    <p><b>LALAS: </b>I get asked about it constantly. And I always tell people that it's OK for myself and for others that were involved in that game to be proud and to be happy about the performance and still recognize that, if by not playing that game or by losing that game, that Escobar would still be alive. We would do that in a second.</p>

    <p><b>ROTHENBERG: </b>The atmosphere going into that game was incomparable: July 4th up in San Francisco, a gorgeous sunny day. I've never seen American soccer fans before &mdash; almost any kind of fans &mdash; get into it the way they did. The streets were just mobbed with everybody with painted red, white and blue faces, singing, and the Brazilians, as colorful as they are, were singing. I remember I was being driven to the game and I made the driver stop about a mile out and I said, "I've got to be a part of this, I want to march with them all, it's just too exciting."</p>

    <div>
      <p><q>The atmosphere was tremendous, number one, those are the moments you live for.</q></p>
    </div>

    <p><b>HARKES: </b>The atmosphere was tremendous, number one, those are the moments you live for whether you're on the field playing or you're in the stadium experiencing that. It was absolutely fantastic and that's the number one thing that I remember. The fans, the support that came out, it was a lot of red, white and blue.</p>

    <p><b>RAMOS:</b> We go into the game and it was the Fourth of July, everything just felt right going into the game for an upset for us. I just felt like it was just going to be the day.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA:</b> I think, collectively, we just said, "Look, one of two things are going to happen. Either we're going to beat the team that is supposed to win this whole thing or we're going to get beaten by the team that will probably win it, so let's just go out there and enjoy it." I didn't start that game and still to this day I have no problem saying it was the biggest disappointment of my career to not be selected for that game.</p>

    <p><b>LALAS: </b>Our approach was that we wanted to try and get guys that could hold the ball at some point, because we knew we were going to be under immense pressure, and so when we broke pressure, we wanted to have at least some guys that could handle the quick pouncing that Brazil would do to get the ball back.</p>

    <p><b>MEOLA:</b> In the midfield, we had one really creative guy that we were depending on that game and that was obviously Tab Ramos.</p>

    <p><b>RAMOS: </b>I know that for me personally, it was probably where I felt my best, really, ever in my career. I think it was my best moment in terms of feeling like mentally and physically I was in a great place. I was having a very good first half on that right side, I created some chances, I was getting fouled on that side by creating danger.</p>

    <p><b>MILUTINOVIC</b>: In the Brazil game everything was perfect, our only problem was when Leonardo made the foul against Tab Ramos. Tab Ramos was very, very important for us.</p>

    <p><b>RAMOS: </b>At the moment I was playing with a lot of confidence and I tried to do a backheel between Leonardo's legs to get out of a tough situation in the corner, and when the ball didn't go through and got stuck between his legs, I kind of reached and tugged on his shirt a little bit, and then came the elbow.</p>

    <p><b>LALAS: </b>We knew at that moment that Tab was in trouble.</p>
    <div><span>
                <div id="RIL_VIDEO_5" class="RIL_video video_type_1">

                    <object align='center'>

                </div></span></div>

    <p><i>Leonardo viciously swung his right elbow backwards, and caught Ramos flush in the side of the head. He dropped to the ground immediately and laid on the field for several minutes. In the meantime, referee Jo&euml;l Quiniou showed Leonardo a red card. With just a minute to go before halftime and the score tied 0-0, the U.S. was up 11 men to 10.</i></p>

    <div>
      <p><q>"No chance, he's got to go to the hospital."</q></p>
    </div>

    <p><b>RAMOS:</b> I went into the locker room and it was only a couple minutes before halftime. Bora wanted to see if I could go back in. He didn't want to sub me out yet, so obviously he went in the locker room and he asked me. I barely even knew where I was at the time, so the doctor said, "No chance, he's got to go to the hospital."</p>

    <p><b>MEOLA:</b> I can remember at halftime, we talked nothing about the game, we went right into the locker room and we saw Tab's eyes were literally rolled up into the back of his head. He didn't know where he was.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA: </b>I was just trying to grab his hand to basically just say, "Hey, you're going to be OK," or just say something and when he moved you could actually see where he got hit, almost the separation of where his skull was cracked, you could see the blood pooling up and it just scared the hell out of me.</p>

    <p>I'll never forget that.</p>

    <p><b>SCHMID: </b>Halftime became a little bit chaotic in the sense that "OK, is Tab going to be able to play? What's his injury situation?" Players were concerned about Tab, players were pissed off about what happened. And so it was a very emotional halftime and it was difficult to get the players focused on what we wanted the tactics to be.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA: </b>In the moment, I think the emotions got the most of us &mdash; we thought he was going to die. I think some of us, myself included, weren't able to figure out a way to just compartmentalize that and just play. I just couldn't.</p>

    <p><b>MEOLA: </b>We lost our most creative guy. Not to say that anyone else wasn't equally important, but that one element of the game we lost that we really needed. If they were going to go down a man, we needed that one guy in the midfield that could really get at people and break them down.</p>

    <p><b>BALBOA: </b>What hurt us was one, John Harkes being out and the second thing that hurt us was Leonardo takes out Tab. We were missing two of the best holders of the ball that we had on that team. Once we lost Tab, we lost control of the midfield. We got a few opportunities here and there, but if you go back to that game, they played with 10 guys and they attacked us, and we defended and defended and defended. We never really got into an attack. So it never really felt like they had a guy thrown out. It seemed like they were still playing with 11.</p>

    <p><b>DOOLEY: </b>(The red card) did not affect the game. Even with 10 men, Brazil was the better team and did not let us play. With luck, we might have got a tie, but realistically there was no chance.</p>

    <p><b>LALAS: </b>From a tactical perspective, we were overwhelmed. Even when Brazil went down a man, their ability to keep the ball was just so superior and eventually we broke down.</p>
    <p><i>With just over 15 minutes left in the game, Brazil finally scored. Romario &mdash; who would go on to win the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player &mdash; broke through the U.S. midfield and laid a pass off to Bebeto, who applied the finish.</i></p>

    <p><b>LALAS: </b>I'll forever think about that little millimeter that separated the ball hitting me as opposed to going through my legs and then in the corner on the slide tackle. Bebeto hits it and it goes right through my legs and past Tony on the other side. It's one thing if I didn't get there, but I got there and even got past the ball, but one of those things where if you look at the way that I slid, it went right through my legs.</p>

    <p><b>MILUTINOVIC: </b>The best satisfaction that I had was how the people appreciated our effort when the game was finished. This was the game that people will remember for a long time, playing against a team that would be the champions of the world. Our team without experience, without so many things, we showed great character, great personality.</p>

    <p><b>MEOLA:</b> The minute we got in the locker room, I don't know how much we really talked about the game to be honest. Everybody was concerned about Tab.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA: </b>Tony is exactly right. I think every single one of us walked into that locker room and the first question was "How's Tab?"</p>

    <p><b>RAMOS:</b> I never did watch the second half of that game ever, I haven't seen it. I found out a couple hours later that we lost the game.</p>

    <p><i>Ramos would be diagnosed with a skull fracture, and wouldn't play again for several months. Leonardo was banned for the rest of the tournament.</i></p>

    <p><b>RAMOS: </b>He came and saw me at the hospital that night. He was crying, he really felt &mdash; even though now he's going to get suspended and not play the rest of the World Cup &mdash; he was concerned about what he had done so he came to see me.</p>
    <h4>Final: USA 0, Brazil 1</h4>
    <div></div>
    <p><i>Even without Leonardo, Brazil would go on to defeat the Netherlands in the quarterfinal, then Sweden in the semifinal. After a 0-0 draw over 120 minutes in the final against Italy, Brazil would prevail in a shootout when Roberto Baggio missed his last PK, becoming the first country to win four World Cup titles. Switzerland lost to Spain in the round of 16, while Romania defeated Argentina before falling to Sweden in penalty kicks in the quarterfinal.</i></p>

    <p><b>BALBOA: </b>To lose to the eventual World Cup champions, you can't complain, but at that time you were disappointed and sad.</p>

    <p><b>LALAS: </b>There was no shame or embarrassment. If there was any regret it came much later and that's just fueled by age and wisdom. Our goal from the start was to get out of our group. Not just from a soccer perspective but what it meant for the country. We were under pressure to not embarrass ourselves and obviously to help grow soccer and in order to do that, it was made very clear to us that we had to get out of the group.</p>

    <div></div>
    <p><b>WYNALDA: </b>We were a story, we were relevant. Regardless of the fact that we lost &mdash; and we did lose to the eventual champion &mdash; there was hope.</p>

    <p><b>HARKES:</b> It was mixed emotions because as a whole, in the big picture we had represented well. It's not as if we went to the second round and got blown away by the world champions. We lost 1-0 and it was very close, so overall it was probably a success, and at the same time, we were hungry for more.</p>

    <p><b>CALIGIURI:</b> From the competitor side, I would say that will live with us forever. You had a great opportunity then to do something bigger and greater. We did great things but that opportunity only happened that one time. It was on July 4th, the world was watching, you're playing against the best team, you get up a man and you lost. The facts are the facts.</p>

    <p><i>Off the field, the tournament had been a huge success. The cumulative attendance of 3,587,538 broke the previous record by more than 1 million, and the average attendance of 68,991 was also a new record. Both marks still stand today.</i></p>
    <p><i>The result was a surplus of approximately $50 million &mdash; more than double original projections. The money went to the newly established U.S. Soccer Foundation, the U.S. Soccer organization created to administer the World Cup surplus.</i></p>

    <p><b>ROTHENBERG: </b>(Without the surplus) Major League Soccer couldn't have existed financially. The World Cup organizing committee through the foundation actually put up the seed money to launch Major League Soccer. We also put up the seed money for the 1999 Women's World Cup and for the 2003 Women's World Cup. Although it was unsuccessful, we contributed a significant amount of money to the 2022 World Cup bid.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA: </b>It was widely regarded as probably the most successful World Cup ever at the time. One of the biggest concerns was people wouldn't even come, people wouldn't care, and that obviously wasn't the case.</p>

    <p><b>HARKES: </b>You can see all the benefits of what we were able to do, from the business side and Alan and the federation itself tremendously working and hosting the games in a great way. Having a league like Major League Soccer start in 1996 for all of us was very exciting.</p>

    <p><b>ROTHENBERG: </b>Even as we were finishing putting on the World Cup, we began to lay the ground for Major League Soccer and in fact, midway through 1993 we created a group within the World Cup Organizing Committee to create the business plan for Major League Soccer. We used the matches of the World Cup to bring in potential sponsors, potential investors and obviously the TV networks.</p>

    <p><i>On April 6, 1996, Major League Soccer played its inaugural game. The San Jose Clash defeated D.C. United 1-0 thanks to a goal by Eric Wynalda.</i></p>

                </div></span></div>

    <p><b>BALBOA: </b>The thing for all of us that was huge is that it introduced soccer to the whole United States, especially when the league was planning on starting within a year-and-a-half of the World Cup. It kind of opened up the door for everybody: sponsors, fans. If it wasn't for having the 1994 World Cup, I'm not sure we'd be here today with MLS.</p>

    <p><b>SCHMID:</b> There were a lot of connections that got established for U.S. soccer and recognition that came to U.S. soccer, doors that were opened for U.S. soccer that weren't opened before. You could also use those doors to get some of those foreign players like a (Carlos) Valderrama into MLS at the beginning of it or Jorge Campos. That all sort of evolved out of that World Cup.</p>

    <p><b>CALIGIURI: </b>Who would have come out and supported MLS if you didn't have American players that you knew of? You knew Harkes and Lalas, and Balboa and Cobi Jones who had just played in a World Cup before that. You could brand it, it was great timing.</p>

    <p><i>Of the 22-man World Cup roster, 20 would go on to play in MLS at some point in their career. Eleven would work for MLS teams as a coach or front office member.</i></p>

    <p><b>STEWART:</b> The World Cup in the U.S. is something that helped develop the game of soccer in the United States and then obviously MLS coming after that. Things started to progress from there to where now we're a regular in the World Cup, we have soccer specific stadiums, we have our own fan base, so things really started to grow from the '94 World Cup.</p>

    <div>
      <p><q>What happened in 1994 changed the history of soccer in this country forever.</q></p>
    </div>

    <p><b>CALIGIURI: </b>The World Cup in 1994 is the single biggest event ever to happen for soccer in this country. It exposed the sport to American sports fans and beyond.</p>

    <p><b>RAMOS: </b>What happened in 1994 changed the history of soccer in this country forever. For me, obviously soccer being my life, I'm very happy to have lived that particular World Cup and that moment because it means and will always mean so much to soccer in this country.</p>

    <p><b>BALBOA: </b>I think the world saw and respected the American player a little more. It opened up doors for me, it opened up a door for Tab and Mike Sorber to go to Mexico, it opened up a huge door for Alexi to go to Italy, it opened up doors for guys to go Germany, so I think it opened up the world for people to say that we can play soccer.</p>

    <p><b>WYNALDA: </b>When I went back to Europe to resume playing for my club team, there definitely was a different attitude toward me personally, toward American players in general. I think that it might have been the turning point.</p>

    <p><b>MILUTINOVIC: </b>We need to remember how it was before and how it is now. In this moment, I am so proud when I see what the American team can do.</p>

    <p><b>MEOLA:</b> I still say all the time, if I had a nickel for every time somebody said, "The World Cup in 1994 made me a fan of soccer," I'd be a rich man today.</p>

    <p><b>LALAS: </b>I lived the power of what a World Cup can do to an individual. My life completely changed. Leno was calling me and Letterman and all these different things. I remember doing J&auml;germeister and tequila shots with the guys from Metallica right after we got let out of the tournament. I milked it for all it was worth and burned it at both ends for a long time and had a blast doing it.</p>

    <p>It's been a wonderful and privileged type of life, and I owe it all to that summer in the World Cup.</p>

        <p>The XFL jumped off the top turnbuckle in 2001 and landed with a blow equal parts short-lived and long lasting. A merging of the schlocky promotions of Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation and the passion and violence of football, the league died after one season, its demise hastened more by a failure of an ill-advised and ultimately doomed business arrangement than a repudiation of the product on the field.</p>
        <p>The XFL's brief life has relegated it to a footnote in American sports history. Yet McMahon's sound-and-fury vision for football echoes in today's NFL, from super huge screens in every stadium to sleeker uniforms to the way networks broadcast the games on TV, with cameras zooming overhead and microphones creeping into every corner.</p>
        <p>Subsequent startup leagues —&nbsp;no matter the sport — have learned as much from what the XFL did right (games in the spring, dedication to the game-day experience, deep start-up funding) as from what it did wrong (provoking NFL fans, insufficient preseason practice, and an unworkable 50-50 ownership with NBC). Going forward, the league provided a case study of both what to do and what not to.</p>
        <p>The sports world measures success and failure by the end result, and on that gauge, the XFL's eight team, 10-game season failed miserably. But sports are supposed to be entertaining, too.</p>
        <p>On those terms, there is only one reality: The XFL lived fast, died young and left a beautiful corpse.</p>

                <p><b>BASIL DEVITO, XFL president:</b> I had already been working for and associated with Vince McMahon for 14, 15 years. Vince outlined the idea and brought me aboard (in late 1999).</p>
                <p>At first I thought it was something that might be down the road, more of a "let's kick the tires and investigate" and potentially something we would spend a very long time just evaluating. I thought it was interesting. But then very quickly I found the vision Vince had was to play in 2001. So it was a lot more intense than when I first thought.</p>

                <p><b>RICH ROSE, XFL business consultant; currently president of AllSport Productions:</b> I go back a long way with Vince McMahon, with WWE, with Basil DeVito. I got a call from Basil, this is back in November of '99, first asking me how quickly I could get to Stamford (Connecticut). I was living in Las Vegas at the time. I told him I could leave the next day. He gave me an idea of what was to come, that Vince had looked into the possibility of creating a football league. I said, "I love it, I'm there."</p>
                <p>I flew out to Connecticut the next day, which was a Wednesday, I think. The next two days Basil and I sat in his office with a grease board, with a bulletin board, with legal pads, and really started to hammer away at creating a business plan, which we did in about 19 days.</p>
                <p><b>PAUL KAYAIAN, managing director of NFL Europe (1994-98); XFL vice president of corporate sponsorship:</b> A friend of mine was working at the WWE. He sent me a note saying, "Hey, they're doing this thing." I'm like, "Ah, thank you, but I've only done real sports," thinking that it was going to be the WWE version of football. Thanks, but no thanks.</p>
                <p>About a week later, he said, "Come on, let me put your name in, it's going to be real." I said, "No offense, I used to be a wrestling fan of Bruno Sammartino, too, but I don't think so." About a day or two after that is the announcement that NBC is now part of it, they're doing a joint venture. So I said, "Oh, great. Now I want the job, and I've already said no." So I quickly called him up, said "OK, put me back in."</p>
                <p><b>JAY HOWARTH, actress; producer-director of the XFL cheerleaders:</b> My instinct was I don't want to be part of this, but I need to do this. It has my name all over this. Because I also produce World Cup games and Olympic shows and whatnot. I produce Hollywood events, these big citywide events. I'm enough of a producer to know that if they call the average cheerleading director, she'll get crucified. I'm also enough in Hollywood to know no one has ever gotten cheerleaders right. ... I didn't know if I was going to be shunned by the sports world. I didn't, by the way, take the job at the XFL until I had spoken personally with both Pat Bowlen (Denver Broncos owner) and Roger Goodell. I was right out of the Denver Broncos, and I had done a lot of work with Roger with NFL Europe and all that kind of stuff.</p>
                <p><b>KAYAIAN:</b> The way it was structured, you got to utilize the resources of the WWE and NBC. NBC was in charge of the production of the game. The WWE, we used their mailroom, literally. We were in their offices. We used their creative department.</p>
                <p>There was one lawyer. I was the sponsorship guy. There was someone in charge of licensing. Everybody understood that. It wasn't top heavy.</p>
                <p>I also learned the definition of entrepreneurial: &nbsp;That means you do everything yourself. But it was OK because, you know what, I filled out the FedEx form. So what? Everybody did more because it was really and truly a startup.</p>
                <p><b>BRIAN KUKLICK, Orlando Rage quarterback:</b> I got asked a million questions when I started talking about possibly being a part of it. Those questions ranged from "Are you going to be a wrestler?" &nbsp;"Is this a joke?" "What is this?" All I could tell people was, I was being contacted previous to being drafted by football people —&nbsp;coaches who were going to coach in the league had backgrounds in the NFL and CFL and NFL Europe and the Arena League.</p>

                <p>I was a football player (Kuklick played at Wake Forest and spent the 1999 season on the Cowboys practice squad). I wasn't in any sense an entertainer other than being a football player. So I knew the legitimacy early on. But it was hard to get that across to people.</p>
                <p><b>KEVIN KAESVIHARN, played two years in the Arena league, one year in the XFL (San Francisco Demons) and nine in the NFL: </b>There were a couple guys who were trying out for the XFL and told me about it. They contacted me, told me a little bit about what was going on, whether or not the league was legitimate. Because I had my concerns, probably like most people, when you thought WWE, or WWF at the time, is it going to be real? Are you going to get drop-kicked in the middle of a play, or clotheslined? How outlandish is it going to be? Once they told me, "Come on out and try out, see what you think," I said, "Sure, I'll give it a try."</p>

                    <h3>Part 1. Gameday: Beer, bros and The Beastie Boys.</h3>


                    <p><b>ROSE:</b> If you have a guiding principle of the WWE and Vince McMahon, it's the live event is where it happens. Give the fan his or her money's worth. When they leave that stadium, leave that arena, you want them to say, "I can't wait to get back. I had fun. I had a great time. It was well worth the money."</p>
                    <p><b>DEVITO:</b> One of our core points of view is that it's our job to put smiles on people's faces, whether it's in a WWE WrestleMania event, a WWE event in Des Moines, or whether it's on television or whether it's just walking down the street, that's our goal in life. When we applied the core beliefs and values of the WWE to the XFL, the fact is, we were looking to entertain people, utilizing professional football as the vehicle.</p>
                    <p><b>TOM VEIT, vice president/general manager of Orlando Rage:</b> The first game was unbelievable. The first game at the Citrus Bowl for the Rage, we sold more beer than any event in the history of the Citrus Bowl. You have to remember, we only sold 36,000 tickets. We didn't open the upper deck.</p>
                    <div>
                        <p><q>We set the beer record. We're pretty proud of that.</q></p>

                        <div id="RIL_IMG_6" class="RIL_image ">
                            <img class="article_image" id="image_6" src="https://pocket-image-cache.com/direct?resize=w2000&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.vox-cdn.com%2Fassets%2F4414963%2Fxflfan2.jpg">
                            <div class="ril_caption">
                                <span class="ril_caption_content"></span>
                                <cite>
                                    <span class="credit_content"></span>
                                </cite>

                    </div>

                    <p>The record had been set at 60,000 from a Jimmy Buffett concert. I can't remember what the number is anymore. We ran out of beer. The beer distributor ran out of beer and had to start shuttling beer in. I think the building holds 64,000. We had 36,000. At 36,000, we set the beer record. We're pretty proud of that.</p>

                    <p><b>KUKLICK: </b>I had a lot of friends and family who came to games. They pointed out to me after the game a few things they had seen in the stands that they had never seen before. It was kind of like a Mardi Gras event or something at times. It was crazy.</p>

                    <p><b>DEVITO: </b>Opening night in Vegas. Remember, we never played a game. Nobody knew who the players were. These were brand new uniforms, uniform colors. The game was sold out. There were people tailgating. If you look at the video now, people are painted in the colors of the Las Vegas Outlaws. It was phenomenal. I mean, every part of that event that night —&nbsp;unfortunately, save the actual football play — was just absolutely spectacular.</p>
                    <p><b>STEVE EHRHART, first executive director of the USFL; vice president/general manager of the Memphis Maniax of the XFL: </b>Here in the Memphis area, because it was kind of a cold, rainy night for the Maniax first game, everybody showed up in camouflage. It was like the greatest gathering of hunting equipment in the world. Thirty-eight thousand people showed up in their camouflage hunting gear. I looked around the stands that night and thought, "Holy cow, I didn't know everybody had camouflage gear."</p>
                    <p><b>VEIT:</b> We had a problem with girls flashing. I was standing on the sidelines before a game. This girl is getting ready to flash. A very attractive young lady. I look at her, and we make eye contact, and I'm shaking my finger at her. <i>Don't do it. Don't do it.</i></p>
                    <p>She's kind of teasing. I grab a security guy, and I jump the wall and walk up. She's with her boyfriend. I said, "If you do this, I'm going to toss you. And your boyfriend. You just can't do it."</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the whole side of the stadium is chanting, "Asshole," at me.</p>
                    <p>The funny part is, she doesn't do it. I walk away. On Monday I get a phone call from the CBS affiliate, saying, "Can we talk to you about the flashing problem?" It had been in the newspaper.</p>
                    <p>They said, "What's the team's view on flashing?" I said, "We're not on board. We don't believe in it. I won't say we're a family atmosphere, but we're not a strip bar, either."</p>
                    <p>They said, "Well, we know that's your policy because we actually had a camera on you." I didn't know it, but they had a camera on me when I went and told the girl she couldn't do it.</p>
                    <p>I said the problem is the Orlando police say it isn't illegal. I said, "You need to go talk to the police chief." Which did not endear me to the police chief or the mayor at the time. But it was the truth. The police were saying, "It's not illegal to flash, so we can't do anything about it."</p>
                    <p>So I was like, for everybody to know, if you want to lift up your shirt at Disneyworld, you're OK.</p>
                    <p><b>HOWARTH: </b>One time, this was one of those great cheerleading moments, where they storm the field at halftime. There's a particular fog. It was cold, the fog came in. It was beautiful. They're standing there in these Matrix-long leather jackets and boots.</p>
                    <p>The music crapped out before they started. The technology failed. We left them hanging, standing there, in these coats, in the breeze, in the fog. The people caught on to what was happening, but the girls can't move. They're not allowed to. We left them hanging for the longest time.</p>
                    <p>When the music kicked in, it was the Beastie Boys, "(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party)." It was such a New York moment, it wasn't even funny. The crowd came unglued, and sang and cheered. It was like a great big Jersey saloon, and it was perfect.</p>

                    <p><b>JOANN KLONOWSKI, chief marketing officer for the Los Angeles Xtreme: </b>The atmosphere was exciting. People loved it. The enormous screen they put up, the dancers. We happened to have a hot tub, too. It was on the field, on the sideline. I don't know how it came about. It might have been one of the guys in our office who was kind of a part-time B-roll actor. He said, "You know, this might be a good idea." We pitched it with the league. Of course, they always liked to do things that were a little different.</p>
                    <p>The guy we had in there —&nbsp;who, by the way, must have been 300 pounds in a Speedo, so he was kind of scary-looking. Someone had brought in some girls to be in the hot tub with him. They turned out to be from one of the clubs around town. So there was a big to-do about that, where the girls came from. We didn't know where the girls came from.</p>
                    <p>Poor J.K. McKay (the team's GM). Everybody's saying, "Did you know those girls came from the Spearmint Rhino (a gentlemen's club)?" They didn't take their clothes off, but they made a whole big to-do about the girls in the hot tub.</p>
                    <p><b>BILLY HICKS, helped launch the World League of American Football; XFL vice president of administration:</b> The second or third week, I was in Las Vegas. I grew up in Arizona, so I brought my mother and father and brother. Maybe even one or two other friends and acquaintances were there. They were down on the front row behind one of the benches. I had stopped to catch up with them for a minute.</p>

                    <p>The guy sitting right next to them was Pat Morita, Mr. Miyagi. The other two guys on the other side of Mr. Miyagi were absolutely three sheets to the wind. They were spending all of their time yelling at the opponents on the bench. That stadium at Vegas, you're very close to the action if you're down there on the 50. You're close enough that you could touch a player's shoulders pad if they came up. They were riding these guys hard.</p>
                    <p>Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere one of them just stops, looks right over at the guy next to him and is like, "Holy (expletive), it's Mr. Miyagi! Hey! Hey! Wax on!" Then he stands up on one leg, and does that move. Here's a guy who I didn't think could stand up at all, and suddenly he's doing a perfect Karate Kid impression.</p>
                    <p>The actor, I don't know why he's sitting there alone, he takes it all in stride. He took it perfectly. Somehow that league invited that kind of mix: My parents sitting next to Mr. Miyagi sitting next to two drunks that were the entertainment.</p>


                    <h3>Part 2. The cheerleaders: &nbsp;"They made them seem so accessible."</h3>

                    <p><b>HOWARTH:</b> One of the funnest parts of this job for me, was I had to pitch a whole collection, a whole league, of costumes to Vince.</p>

                    <p>I was talking with Basil DeVito, who was our commissioner, and Billy (Hicks), and they dialed me up and said, "Don't spend any time on it. Vince always knows exactly what he wants, don't get your heart set on anything. He'll probably spend five minutes with you."</p>

                    <p>So in the name of sports and cheerleaders and sports chicks everywhere, we got partners and designers and New York City chicks and the best costume maker, and we designed the whole collection before I walked into Vince that day. The five minutes in the meeting hook? We were in there for an hour and 45 minutes, and he loved every single design that we pitched.</p>

                    <p><b>HOWARTH: </b>If the crowd didn't look down and go, <em>they did not!</em> I hadn't done my job.</p>
                    <p><b>EHRHART:</b> They tried to make it that the cheerleaders were so X-rated. The real truth was they valued that and tried to say somehow it was going to be extreme. They said, "We'll go straight into the locker room of the cheerleaders, get up close and personal." The real truth was you couldn't get much skimpier than the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.</p>

                    <p><b>KUKLICK:</b> At the time there was a rule, and there still may be, where (NFL) cheerleaders can't date players. That was one of McMahon's big things: <i> I don't care if our players date cheerleaders.</i> They had their lives, and we had our lives. It wasn't a big deal at all.</p>
                    <p><b>HOWARTH:</b> Vince was running around the media saying, "If the cheerleaders were shtupping the players, we were going to talk about it." Reality TV —&nbsp;that is what he was on to. I had to face that everywhere I went, which was funny.</p>
                    <p><b>HICKS:</b> I've got a poster in my office of XFL cheerleaders because people like to talk about that. It's always a conversation starter. I'm looking at it, and costume-wise, there's nothing on there I'm looking at right now that you don't see on an NFL sideline today. Maybe the most provocative would have been what we did out in Vegas, because they were just a little more Wild West than some of the others. But again, there's probably more fabric there than the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders are wearing today. But yes, we did promote it every chance we got.</p>
                    <p>We teased this thing quite loudly, where we took the camera and the whole pregame show was in the cheerleaders' locker room. I don't think the final product ever lived up to the tease that we had given it. But that's often (the case), just like professional wrestling as well, it's all about the promo.</p>
                    <p><b>HOWARTH:</b> Vince McMahon was the Anti-Christ to the cheerleader image —&nbsp;that would have been my knee-jerk guess. The truth is, he was a champion for me and cheerleading. Complete and total champion for me. I could state my case, and explain it to him. He's an amazing entertainment producer, one of the best. And if I could explain my case in a way that he could understand, he would make sure I had what I needed. Whether it was broad stroke like budget or putting cheerleaders in the hot tub at Los Angeles at halftime —&nbsp;I had to have some of the most ridiculous conversations ever in my lifetime with Vince McMahon.</p>
                    <p><b>MATT HOGG, center for the Birmingham Bolts:</b> They made them seem so accessible. But c'mon.</p>
                    <h3>Part 3. The football: Oh, yeah, the XFL had players and games, too.</h3>
                    <p><b>CHARLES PULERI, quarterback of the New York/New Jersey Hitmen</b>: The level of play was excellent. I played in the Arena league. I played in Canada. Before that I played in NFL Europe. I was with the Cowboys. Obviously the first 30 guys on an NFL roster are the best in the world. But from 30 to 53, those are the guys that were circling the Arena league, the Canadian league and the XFL.</p>

                    <p>There were a lot of ex-NFL players in the league. I would say it was really, really good football. Now, with all the circus around it, that kind of put a dent in it, from my perspective. But the football was every bit as good any of those leagues.</p>
                    <p><b>KAESVIHARN:</b> I'm not going to say it was terrible. But it wasn't top-notch NFL-type players, either. There were a select few that were good and a select few who went on to the NFL. But you can say the same thing about the NFL. There are some guys in the NFL who probably don't belong there, and guys that aren't there who should be there. But for the most part, you're going to get the best of the best in the NFL. When you're talking about the cream of the crop in the NFL and comparing that to the XFL, of course there's no comparison.</p>
                    <p><b>YO MURPHY, played in the Super Bowl, two Grey Cups and a World Bowl (the NFL Europe championship game); wide receiver for the Las Vegas Outlaws: </b>When I got there, I was surprised about the money they were paying out. I think starting off, they made it so fun to play ... they could have sacrificed and not paid the players so much, and I think the league would have been around longer.</p>
                    <p>Guys would have fought to play in that league because it was fun. That makes up for a lot. As long as you pay your bills and take care of your family, the opportunity to play and compete in professional football makes up for a lot.</p>
                    <p><b>MIKE KELLER, former NFL player, currently president of the startup A-11 football league, which will feature all offensive players eligible to be receivers; XFL's vice president of football operations: </b>The plain fact was that the product was very good. We had over 100 players go on to play in the National Football League. That's a large number. That's quality players.</p>
                    <p>But I will say this, also: When you're a start-up league, the coaches who are coaching have never coached together before. The players had never played together before. One of the mistakes, and I will take credit for it, is we had a four-and-a-half week training camp. And for a first-year league, it wasn't enough.</p>
                    <p>We needed more time for those players who hadn't played together before and the coaches who hadn't coached together before to pull together so that when they took the field in the first game of the season we were in midseason form. We weren't.</p>
                    <p>It took us two or three games before the play really got to the point where you'd say, "This is indistinguishable from the National Football League," which it was by the end. But by that time, we had had a lot of television sets clicking off. But even with that, the ratings we had at the end of the season were still very, very good.</p>

I think we stayed at the Palace Station. My memories of that are eating the buffet food night after night and hearing the ching-ching-ching in the back of your head the entire time. Eventually, yeah, it's like being by the railroad tracks and you don't hear it. But I'm telling you initially, that got to you night after night after night.</p>
                    <p>We went to play the Birmingham Bolts. We had to stay in Tupelo, Mississippi, or something like that. We're staying at this casino, again.

                    <p>Now, let's face it, we were already starting out with the next level of football down after the NFL. So our skill players were not the best in the world, they were the best available. Now we're giving them a football which is harder to catch and throw.</p>
                    <p>So we're working with Spalding to try to work this out. There's not a big answer. Well, I'm a baseball guy. I grew up playing baseball. (DeVito played for Ohio University's baseball team.) What do they do with every baseball before the game? They rub it in the silt, right?</p>
                    <p>So about 2 o'clock in the morning, I had this idea. I ran down to my basement, and I took a football and I started using steel wool, I used different (things).</p>
                    <p>I found out if you took 60-grade sandpaper and sandpapered the whole ball, it barely changed the look of the black, and guess what? Just that scouring of the outside —&nbsp;I ran upstairs, I got in the shower, I got the football wet, and at 2 o'clock in the morning, with myself in the shower, I've got a football, and I'm yelling out loud —&nbsp;my then-wife thought I was actually crazy —&nbsp;I said, "This is what we do —&nbsp;all we have to do is sandpaper all the footballs before we put them in play, and that will solve the problem."</p>
                    <p><b>GERRY DINARDO, head coach of the Birmingham Bolts:</b> They were allowed to put anything on the back of their jersey, name-wise. None of our guys did anything but their names. In fact, I got a letter from the league office saying, "Stop holding your kids back from putting nicknames on their jerseys." I said, "I'm not. I haven't said a word. I don't care." But I said, "I'll post the letter in the locker room," and I did.</p>
                    <p><b>KUKLICK: </b>The whole name on the back of the jersey thing, we decided as a team we weren't going to do anything like that. We were just going to put our last name on the jerseys. McMahon didn't like that. He thought our coach (Galen Hall) had instructed us not to do that. So he sent a letter to every player on our team, and we had to sign it saying it was our decision not to put a funny name on our jersey, and not our coach's decision.</p>
                    <p><b>PULERI: </b>As the season was going on, they were trying to get that wrestling theme. Jesse "The Body" Ventura was one of the announcers. I think he was still governor (of Minnesota) at the time. Prior to the games, he was making fun of the team, he was making fun of me because I'm from the Bronx, and he made comments the first week saying, "Do they even have football in the Bronx?"</p>

                    <p>When we got to Soldier Field, he came into the locker room with the Secret Service, and they're all protecting him. He's walking in kind of like apologizing, <i>It's all BS, it's all media stuff, I didn't mean it, blah blah blah.</i></p>
                    <p>I was like, "Man, you killed me." The first week, there was so much backlash. My friends and family, people from New York City were like, "This guy's a clown." For him to say that he apologized, kind of made it feel a little bit better. But the damage had already been done. That's when people really started to tune out, with people making dumb comments like that, reaching for stuff, trying to create drama.</p>
                    <p>When I met him, I was really talking about his movie career. He was in that movie, "Predator." His biggest line was, "I ain't got time to bleed." So when he was in the locker room, we were all busting his chops about it.</p>
                    <p><b>SCOTT MILANOVICH, backup quarterback for the Los Angeles Xtreme and first player ever drafted in the XFL. Now the coach of the Toronto Argonauts: </b>We were playing in the championship game. I think they called it the Million Dollar Game, so if you won, you got an extra $25,000. We were winning heavily, heavily enough that I actually went into the game in mop-up time (the Xtreme beat the San Francisco Demons, 38-6).</p>
                    <p>So at the end of the game —&nbsp;I'm actually embarrassed to tell this story now —&nbsp;I'm in the game, and I'm calling my own plays. I'm just trying to run out the clock and get the heck out of there. The game was over. There was no chance they were going to come back.</p>
                    <p>They kept blitzing us. All of our running backs were getting killed. And they were calling timeout. I finally got irritated enough that I drew up a play in the huddle: a halfback pass. It wasn't even in our game plan. I was upset that they kept blitzing us and calling timeout. Anyway, long story short, it went for a touchdown. People on the other side of the field weren't thrilled with me.</p>
                    <p><b>DEVITO:</b> My fondest memory is going to make me cry. (It came) at the end of the Million Dollar Game —&nbsp;which internally we were calling The Big Game At The End —&nbsp;in the Los Angeles Coliseum, between the Los Angeles Xtreme and the San Francisco Demons.</p>
                    <p>When the game was over, in the middle of the L.A. Coliseum, the site of former Olympics in the '30s and Dodger baseball and Mickey Mantle playing on that field against the Dodgers, I stood off at midfield. One of my sons had accompanied me to the game. When it was all over, the celebration of the team was going on, he and I were on the 50-yard line, just the two of us. I was kneeling down. He was about 10 years old at the time. Just taking it in. Not in the whole big group, not with the players, just the two of us.</p>
                    <p>Luckily someone snapped a picture of it. I remember at the time telling him, "Grab this moment. This has been a unique thing, a unique moment in time. I'm glad you're here with me." It was a really cool moment for me, and I have a picture of it.</p>

He plays this bombastic guy that people want to see clobbered over the head with a chair. That is part of him. He plays that role because he knows that is entertainment that brings out either animosity or love or creates emotions in people.</p>
                        <p>He's just a master at being able to play the role. But from a standpoint of running a business and treating his people with respect —&nbsp;he's tough, don't get me wrong. He's not a patsy. You do your job, and you're in great shape. If you screw up more than once, he's going to come down on you like a ton of bricks. I appreciate that.

This league could have lasted. It could have been a spring version of football. People would have come out, as you saw in the first few weeks. But they kind of went to the wrestling side of it, trying to make up storylines and drama.</p>
                        <p><b>HOWARTH:</b> I was watching Vince rip into the NFL in a particular way (at a press conference), challenge the NFL in a particular way. I said to myself, "He's crazy. He's a human target right now."</p>
                        <p>I worked for the NFL for years. You just didn't challenge the NFL like he was standing up there challenging them. (But) we had some kind of 95 percent recognition because of the way he promoted. I learned a few things —&nbsp;we all learned a few things. Because he was fearless.</p>


                        <h3>Part 2. "He told the other networks ‘You can take it and shove it.'"</h3>

                        <p><b>ROSE: </b>We had looked about the possibility of expansion. Basil and I, and I think Mike Keller was with us, we had gone to Detroit, to Tiger Stadium, before it was demolished, which was obviously a good football market. I also went up to Milwaukee, to Miller Park. We had researched that, and that was one of the things I was involved with, so we would be prepared going forward.</p>
                        <p>There were a number of issues and elements that we were discussing. It wasn't, "Oh, OK, the season's over, we're out of here." No. We had been doing this work all along. We were moving forward.</p>
                        <p><b>DINARDO:</b> We were playing a game in Legions Field. I'm walking off at halftime. My personnel guy says, "Vince wants you in L.A. tomorrow, we're having a meeting."</p>
                        <p>It was a Sunday game. We had a Saturday game coming up, so it was a short week. I said, "I'm not going to L.A." I'm already against the clock, six days to get ready for a game.</p>
                        <p>One thing led to another, and Vince made it clear that I was going. So we show up in L.A. at the Marriott. Ratings are down. Birmingham had just played the week before. It may have been the lowest rated prime-time show in the history of (network) TV at that time. There was something like that.</p>
                        <p>We wind up in L.A., the eight coaches, Vince, and the suits of NBC. They get to talking about how they're going to get the ratings up. There's one guy who was a friend or consultant for NBC. Didn't work for NBC. He says, "You know, I grew up in the Bronx, and we used to play this game we called two-hand touch. And everybody was eligible. Why don't we make everybody eligible next week?"</p>
                        <p>The coaches looked at one another. I was trying to get out of the room because if I didn't catch the next flight to Birmingham ... I'm saying to hell with this. I'll do whatever they want me to do.</p>

                        <p>Kippy Brown, the head coach of Memphis, and Galen Hall stood up and said, "Vince, you told us this would never happen. You told us this would always be football, with some changes." Right then, Vince turned to NBC and said, "We're not doing it."</p>
                        <p>I believe that is the beginning of their separation.</p>
                        <p><b>VEIT: </b>Our partnership with NBC was the greatest boon to launching the league and probably the greatest distraction (that caused the league to fold).</p>
                        <p><b>EHRHART:</b> One of the lessons is it's never good to have a 50-50 partner. Somebody has to be in charge.</p>
                        <p><b>KELLER:</b> We had three television partners. We had NBC, we had UPN (United Paramount Network), and we had TNN. All of our games were televised. We had three television partners because they all believed in Vince McMahon. That was the upside. The downside became that NBC decided to pull out.</p>
                        <p>When NBC pulled out, UPN and TNN went to Vince McMahon and said, "OK, we want to stay in, but if we're going to do so, we want to renegotiate our television contract with the WWF."</p>
                        <p>When that happened, Vince, number one, he was insulted. Number two, he told the other networks "You can take it and shove it. I'm not going to let anything affect my core business," which was the WWF.</p>
                        <p>That was never really talked about much. It wasn't that the play wasn't good. It wasn't that we didn't have good attendance. It wasn't that we didn't have good ratings. It was all because of this political power play that was going on behind the scenes.</p>
                        <p><b>DINARDO:</b> We were in big (league-wide) meetings. We broke for dinner, and then we got a call in the hotel saying there was a conference call at like 5 or 6 o'clock, during the dinner break. My personnel guy comes into my hotel room, and we dial in. I think we were on speakerphone. Sure enough, there's an announcement that it's over. I mean, we were on dinner break. And that was it.</p>
                        <p><b>EHRHART: </b>My own personal feeling is they pulled the plug too early. It was some great success in just getting the name recognition out there and building a new piece of younger demographic fans. Why pull the plug after the first year? There were some losses in some of the cities, certainly. But there was some great success, too. That was the one thing that was so disappointing, the pulling of the plug after one year.</p>
                        <p><b>HOGG: </b>I don't think to this day I've ever got a phone call from anybody in the league office or a letter saying you're terminated or anything like that.</p>
                        <p>I'll never forget this. I'm sitting in Medina, Ohio, south of Cleveland. I'm watching the 11 o'clock news. The ticker scrolls across the bottom that the XFL has folded. So I yelled up to my wife, "Honey, I'm unemployed."</p>
                        <p><b>HICKS:</b> None of us will ever know exactly what led to the decision. But it was made, and it came down, and a lot of the key players who had spent 16, 18 months working every day to create something turned around and worked equally hard to dismantle it as quickly as possible and dissolve a company so two publicly traded companies could get it off their books. That was something I'll never get to do again. That's something you'll put on a résumé, but nobody will ever be looking for that talent.</p>
                        <p><b>VEIT:</b> When the league shut down, Vince and Basil came back and made sure I was taken care of and I had the opportunity to find a new job. Financially, they came back and made sure I was taken care of, which they didn't have to do.</p>
                        <p>When we shut down, we paid every nickel of every dime of every bill that we owed. There wasn't one person out there that got screwed because they were a vendor. My accounting director and I had to hand-sign 1,400 checks to send out to season-ticket holders as refunds.</p>
                        <div>
                            <p><q>You're not going to hear one person in one city, one employee, or anything, say, "I got screwed."</q></p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Vince is a very honest man. People have different views of him. But when you look at the way the XFL shut down, you're not going to hear one person in one city, one employee, or anything, say, "I got screwed."</p>
                        <p><b>ROSE: </b>That was one of my responsibilities, with Basil, was closing down the league.</p>
                        <p>I had been in Stamford in June. We said, OK, we'll get through the summer. I'll be doing stuff on the computer, the phone, and on faxes. We'll regroup in the fall and finish everything up, make sure we've ended our leases for the stadiums, whatever office space we had.</p>
                        <p>I spent the summer on the West Coast. I made the trip back. My first flight in two-and-a-half months, heading back to Stamford, was Monday night, September 10th. I landed at John F. Kennedy airport at 6: 30 in the morning, Tuesday morning, September 11, 2001.</p>
                        <p>So I was in New York for 9-11.</p>
                        <p>I got off the plane, took a car up to Stamford, checked into the hotel, and I'm in the bathroom shaving, because I had to be at the office at 9:30. All of a sudden, I had The Today Show on in the background, and the first plane hit the tower. All Basil and I did that first day was sit in his office and watch the television.</p>
                        <p><b>DEVITO</b>: It's hard to capsulize any one reason. Ultimately, it was a partnership between NBC and the WWE. And everything was collaborative. And the fact is, it was not ready for prime time at the time. It didn't seem to make sense for every one to keep going and putting more money into the project at that particular time. ... It was only a couple of years later that WWE and NBC made an agreement on "Raw," which has continued until now. When organizations that have a rough time together still want to do business, it shows a certain manner of operation, which was important.</p>

                            <p><b>KAYAIAN:</b> I still to his day will argue that, when you watch an NFL game, they will never get credit, but when they have microphones on the field, and they have refs mic'd and players mic'd and coaches mic'd, we did 98 percent of that. We didn't have to follow the rules. We didn't have any head of communications telling us, "You have one question, outside of the 20-yard line, at the end of the half, make it quick, done, go to the locker room."</p>

                            <p><b>EHRHART: </b>We built those huge video screens at the stadiums. The WWF had kind of pioneered them. Now that's led to the installation of huge screens across the country, both college and the NFL. The big screen thing was immensely popular. I don't think people appreciate how much that has changed NFL stadiums. I give credit to McMahon for that.</p>
                            <p><b>DEVITO:</b> All the networks were always clamoring to do more and have more access, even before the XFL. The fact we were able to do it, and show how to do it, was the one ingredient that allowed the networks to push harder on all the leagues for the access.</p>
                            <p><b>HOWARTH: </b>We had flying cameras, we had helmet cameras, we had huddle cameras, we had a guy on the field running around. My God, what a great experiment we were empowered with. It was an incredible opportunity to look at every single aspect of the machine and ask the question, what would you if you could do it differently? How would you do it? How would you take it up a notch?</p>
                            <p><b>ROSE: </b>You look at the elements that came out of the XFL TV-wise. Skycam. You know how popular Skycam is. The interviews on the sideline and in the locker room and stuff, we had that access. That's commonplace now.</p>
                            <p>The one thing that other people didn't pick up was something we innovated called Bubba cam. It was called Bubba cam because the camera operator was named Bubba. He had a mount that went on his chest, and he had the camera on his shoulder, and he would literally go into the huddle. When they broke to the line of scrimmage, he would run off the field.</p>
                            <p><b>WELDON:</b> We were playing in New York. I told the guys in the huddle, "Hey, look, go low, I'm going to quarterback sneak." Not realizing it was being broadcast to the crowd. They hit me right in the mouth.</p>
                            <p><b>KLONOWSKI:</b> The point after —&nbsp;now the NFL might change that. I think that was a good change. The point after, you typically go to the refrigerator to grab a beer. With the XFL, instead, you had to watch, it had to be a throw or a pass. I think that's a lot more exciting.</p>
                            <p><b>KAESVIHARN: </b>Some of the rules that I thought would help the NFL that might still be considered —&nbsp;no fair catches on punts, a punt is a live ball. That would change the strategy of the game, if you gave the offense another opportunity to come up with the ball somehow or retain possession.</p>
                            <p>Having guys running around on the field with a camera? I don't see that happening in the NFL. I can tell you one thing that's not going to work out — the (no) coin toss. (Instead of a coin toss, the XFL placed the ball at the 50 and had one player from each team fight for it —&nbsp;they called it "The Scramble.")</p>
                            <p><b>VEIT</b>: Whoever recovered the ball, that's how you'd determine who would kick off. My safety, first play, first game, sprained his collarbone and got lost for the season. It's not my favorite story.</p>

                            <p><b>DINARDO: </b>I think they had to come to some agreement with the NFL. This was the furthest thing from Vince. The first game, he called it the No-Fun League on national TV.</p>

                            <p><b>HOGG:</b> Maybe something between what the UFL or some of these other minor leagues have been and what the XFL was trying to be. The UFL tried to go super cheap. The XFL went out with a bang.</p>
                            <p><b>KUKLICK:</b> I wouldn't be surprised if you saw something similar come back, some sort of league for the NFL beyond college football for guys to get experience. There are so many guys out there with talent, so many guys who can play.</p>
                            <p><b>ROSE</b>: I do believe that if we had played that second year, we'd still be in business today. There were opportunities. I think the NFL was at that point where they were ready to pull the plug on NFL Europe. Maybe there might have been an opportunity for us to work with them.</p>
                            <p><b>KAYAIAN</b>: If we had had another season, I'm absolutely convinced we'd still be there. Part of the reason was part of the pitch: We never said to any player or any coach, don't play for them, play for us. We never said to anybody don't watch them, watch us. That's exactly why we started the week after the Super Bowl. A large part of the pitch was, you love football, you're really disappointed when football season's over. And the Pro Bowl doesn't really satisfy that. So we're going to continue playing real football with a slightly different, contemporary twist.</p>

  </div><div><h2>How to buy college football players, in the words of a man who delivers the money</h2><div>

  <div>
    <p>The Bag Man excuses himself to make a call outside, on his "other phone," to arrange delivery of $500 in cash to a visiting recruit. The player is rated No. 1 at his position nationally and on his way into town. We're sitting in a popular restaurant near campus almost a week before National Signing Day, talking about how to arrange cash payments for amateur athletes.</p>
    <p>"Nah, there's no way we're landing him, but you still have to do it," he says. "It looks good. It's good for down the road. Same reason my wife reads Yelp. These kids talk to each other. It's a waste of money, but they're doing the same thing to our guys right now in [rival school's town]. Cost of business."</p>
    <p>Technically, this conversation never happened, because I won't reveal&nbsp;this man's name or the player's, or even the town I visited. Accordingly, all the other conversations I had with different bag men representing different SEC programs over a two-month span surrounding National Signing Day didn't happen either.</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>Even when I asked for and received proof -- in this case a phone call I watched him make to a number I independently verified, then a meeting in which I witnessed cash handed to an active SEC football player -- it's just cash changing hands. When things are done correctly, there's no proof more substantial than one man's word over another. That allows for plausible deniability, which is good enough for the coaches, administrators, conference officials, and network executives. And the man I officially&nbsp;didn't speak with was emphatic that no one really understands how often and how well it almost always works.</p>
    <p>These men are fans who believe they're leveraging football success $500 or $50,000 at a time. I can't show you that money, and neither can anyone else. You might think you see <i>the</i> money -- a flash of $20 bills all over some kid's Instagram or Facebook update -- but that's just&nbsp;money.</p>
    <p>This is the arrangement in high-stakes college football, though of course not every player is paid for. Providing cash and benefits to players is not a scandal or a scheme, merely a function. And when you start listening to the stories, you understand the function can never be stopped.</p>
    <p>"Last week I got a call. We've got this JUCO transfer that had just got here. And he's country poor. The [graduate assistant] calls me and tells me he's watching the AFC Championship Game alone in the lobby of the Union because he doesn't have a TV. Says he never owned one. Now, you can buy a Walmart TV for $50. What kid in college doesn't have a TV? So I don't give him any money. I just go dig out in my garage and find one of those old Vizios from five years back and leave it for him at the desk. I don't view what I do as a crime, and I don't give a shit if someone else does, honestly."</p>
    <p>"If we could take a vote for these kids to make a real salary every season, I would vote for it. $40,000 or something. Goes back to mama, buys them a car, lets them go live like normal people after they work their asses off for us. But let's be honest, that ain't gonna stop all this. If everyone gets $40,000, someone would still be trying to give 'em 40 extra on the side."</p>
    <p>This is how you become a college football bag man.</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>I. "Just hang out and learn to keep your mouth shut."</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>Chances are you didn't just wake up one day and decide that your passion for Team A was suddenly worth forking over money to entice and reward student-athletes. If you haven't already grown up in your team's culture, you start going to games, first as a student, then a young alum, then a married alum, and then as a young family. You become a person everyone in your age group knows has enough money that a low-five-figure deduction wouldn't be missed.</p>
    <p>One caveat. If you're stinking, filthy rich, a good athletic director or university fundraiser has already contacted you for above-board donations, and you likely won't get into the business of paying players. It's the guys with just about 10 or 15 grand to burn annually that usually become bag men.</p>
    <p>"I think it took me seven years. I knew some guys. They knew some older guys. And before, I really didn't believe any of this happened. Then I start coming around different events, parties, tailgates. After a while one guy says, 'Oh hey, I know him. It's okay, he loves the [team],' and starts talking who needed to get what. And so I was a part of it. I wanted to be."</p>
    <p>Once properly vetted, your money usually buys you first or secondhand access to information most fans (or journalists) would kill for: player run-ins with the law that go unreported, what certain coaches are really like, what kind of power an A.D. or president really has, and most importantly, who really is in charge of your football program.</p>
  </div>
  <div><span><h3>II. Discover Crootsylvania, the Pay-Me State.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>Southern states feature vastly different cultural, economic and physical territories, but every state with a school in the SEC contains a few consistent features from which a kind of map can be built:</p>
    <ul><li>
      <p>The university housing your team.</p>
    </li>
      <li>
        <p>A capital city. Your school likely has some concentration of lawyers or elected officials.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The metro area (sometimes also the capital), the state's most populated and therefore talent-rich area.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A community or city closest to your state's border with another conference state.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Enemy territory. Just as your team has boosters active in other states, so too are enemy agents inside your borders. In many cases they're concentrated in a single area, like an in-state rival's town, a town close to the border, or just an area with a concentration of sidewalk fans who support someone else.</p>
      </li>
    </ul><p>From these areas, borders are drawn and districts are created, but over time specific territories are shaped by the bag men in them. It's a somewhat fluid map, at least over long amounts of time.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the state, a school's bag men gravitate towards two centers of power: the university and the state's metro area, the latter because of population, the former because of power. Regardless of where top-dollar shadow boosters and bag men might live, the university town serves as the primary center of operations. After all, that's where the coaches and players are.</p>
  </div>
  <div><span><h3>III. Even shadow governments have staff meetings.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>Bag men tend to operate in plain sight. And while there might be a kind of cabal of particularly rich boosters who direct operations at private meetings, there aren't dungeons and robes or some kind of "X-Files" syndicate in a smoky boardroom.</p>
    <p>"No secret lair, although a couple guys have some pretty ridiculous-looking hunting camps. I mean, we're shooting the shit about college football players. That in and of itself isn't a crime. Sometimes we go to the Waffle House."</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>The rules of communication tend to follow your typical sleeper cell or drug-dealing outfit. Talk in person as much as possible, preferably in group settings. Don't use email. Never interact with the media and avoid the university's public relations or sports information departments whenever possible. And buy burners. Lots of burners.</p>
    <p>"It's the bat phone. Everybody has a bat phone. Buy some in a gas station out of town, use 'em for a while, toss 'em. The worst part was convincing my wife it wasn't so I could carry on an affair, because I wouldn't let her use it or see who I was talking to."</p>
    <p>Burners are seasonal and used mostly around the height of recruiting season, when local bag men need to communicate quickly with other shadow boosters across the state and region higher up the fiscal chain. Later on they'll be used to communicate directly with active players. But calls are often made to a person's primary number, and in a pinch basic code-talking will suffice.</p>
    <p>"I can call up a guy in real estate and say, 'Hey man, we thought about it, and let's do that 24-acre plot. How's a 4 p.m. meeting sound?'"</p>
    <p>The first number is the player, usually designated by a jersey number. Here, it's player No. 24. The time is the cost. In this example, $4,000. Listen long enough and it's not much of a code, but there's never been much to codebreaking here, either.</p>
    <p>"I don't sell drugs. I don't even speed on the highway. No one's listening to me."</p>
  </div>
  <div><span><h3>IV. (Don't) get to know your head coach.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>There's a weird code of personal conduct for a bag man. It's okay to be flashy, but within the limits. Set up your lavish tailgate, put a deposit down on a luxury box, or name your child after a famous player or coach. After all, you're passionate enough to be paying, so you might as well enjoy yourself.</p>
    <p>But while drawing attention to yourself is fine, drawing importance to yourself is forbidden. You are now somebody in one very small social circle but forever destined to be nobody in the public eye.</p>
    <p>"Coach has met me a few times. I've talked to Coach. But Coach doesn't really know me from Adam. How many other folks do you think he meets a week? After he got hired, I walked up and shook his hand, and the guy introducing us says, "Hey Coach, this here's [first name], he takes care of stuff for us.' Now, what does that really mean? Do I charter planes for the university? Do I run a company that sells concessions to the stadium? Or do I make sure kids get taken care of? Coach doesn't know what I 'take care of.' He knows someone out there is doing this, and that's all."</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>A good bag man will never be famous. He will never be that guy hovering right next to the head coach after a big win. His name will never be known by the majority of students, fans, and alumni of the university he loves. There is no dead bag man memorial on the campus of any football powerhouse. There are no memorial scholarships named after the guy who gave a running back's mother $3,000 a month for four years.</p>
    <p>"There's some guy I know. He's in the [official booster club for the university]. I've known him almost all my life; he's a friend of my family. Guy gives about $50,000 a year to the program. And so he gets to wear a jacket and have his name in the [annual alumni magazine] and gets to shake hands with the coaches and feel really goddamn important. I see this guy all the time, and we talk about the team, and he's always trying to big dick about how important he is to the program. Now let me ask you, who do you think is more important to this team winning next season? Him with his $50,000 getting bathrooms painted in the basketball arena, or what I do with not even a quarter of that much money?"</p>
    <p>Bottom line: if you're successful in landing a player who is in turn successful on the field, and you can't abide people not knowing you had a hand in the process, you're in the wrong field of athletic support.</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>V. There is never a bank account. There is only cash</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>You've probably read a detailed breakdown on some message board about how your rival school managed to land that prized wide receiver, and it probably involves something to do with a bank account.</p>
    <p>The player might have been bought, but he didn't pop into the local savings and loan to pick up his check. Bank accounts carry more potentially traceable information than any other facet of an illegal payments system, even more than phone records. Yet in almost every popular Internet rumor about a recruit's family being paid off, there's some mention of a bank account or a slush fund that boosters pay into and athletes take out of.</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>"If you hear stories about bank accounts, they're fake. Why would there be a bank account? Yeah, I'm gonna open a checking account with statements someone could subpoena. Oh and hey, in this small town of however-many-thousands of people I'm gonna go in and open some account and then ask for a bunch of black teenagers to be put on there and ask for a bunch of debit cards they could get caught with. Why don't I just take out a fucking ad?"</p>
    <p>There might not be a FDIC-insured savings account at a local bank branch, but there is always a pool from which money can be accessed quickly. A majority of fundraising occurs in the offseason, when coaches visit alumni and booster clubs throughout their schools' regions.</p>
    <p>"The coach or coaches come in, say their piece, bullshit with the folks and take pictures and then they're in the car and headed back home. When they leave, we start talking. What we figure out then is what we need to put together in that area [of the state] for anyone we're trying to land from that area. That's when the hat gets passed."</p>
    <p>The actual money is never collected in a single area, but a collective of shadow boosters keeps an unwritten counter on how much each of them can contribute in cash at any given moment for three major purposes:</p>
    <ol><li><span>Large single sums to be paid out in order to convince a recruit to sign with the school.</span></li>
      <li><span>Maintenance payments to current players, delivered in an ongoing basis.</span></li>
      <li><span>Cash owed by an out-of-area shadow booster to a bag man living in the college town. Sometimes a player whose sponsor lives back at home needs money immediately, so a local bag man not assigned to that player will pay the player, with a marker going to his booster back home.</span></li>
    </ol><p>The small business fuels America. Cash that doesn't have to be accounted for exists in any variety of ways. Sell a pair of lower bowl tickets to a guy you know from church? Cash. Sell a bass boat on Craigslist? Cash. Run or own a restaurant? Cash. Work in agriculture? Lots of cash.</p>
    <p>"We all do different things. Finding liquid capital is not a problem for any of us. If it was, we wouldn't be doing this."</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>VI. The rules of courting</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>Some towns or high schools have already made a recruit's decision before he's out of diapers. These are strongholds. The local money, the high school coaches and principals, the parents and the "uncles" are already all on the same team.</p>
    <p>This is built by heritage and takes decades and sometimes millions of dollars. Maybe it's a local business that employs working-class families. Jobs for parents can be arranged with ease, as can pressure on those currently employed.</p>
    <p>A player can be identified as a prospect in middle school, either by a coach friendly to your program or a bag man himself. A collegiate head coach would never inform a bag man of his preferences, but in a well-run program, his desires would be known without communicating them.</p>
    <p>Extenuating factors to consider when putting together a plan:</p>
    <ul><li>
      <p>What's the climate of the high school? Does the high school coach lean towards or away from your college program?</p>
    </li>
      <li>
        <p>Is this a stronghold town or disputed territory? How fast will competition come in? Or is someone already in with the family, meaning you're the competition?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What's the economic status of the family? Any criminal history? Could other incentives (jobs, cars) be arranged?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What is the family dynamic? Who other than the mother or grandmother is workable? ("I've never encountered a situation where a parent or guardian worried about the legality. I can't say that's ever even been asked of me.")</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Who is the one person that can be trusted to take payments before the player signs and keep the money out of public view?</p>
      </li>
    </ul><p>"If mama's been working all her life to provide, you can make that work. That's a very manageable situation. But if you've got an uncle talking about being the kid's manager or agent, talking about his rap label he's starting or interviews with ESPN, shit ... you better hold on, or reevaluate how bad you want this player."</p>
    <p>Often a full assessment of a recruit's situation reveals that a promise of cash payments isn't the way to go. Sometimes a recruit's family could be so far under the poverty line that any kind of sudden flush spending would draw the attention of the NCAA, or the recruit is so high-profile that he's receiving multiple cash gifts from competing boosters. That's when the personal touch becomes a better option.</p>
    <p>"I've paid to put a single mother through rehab. It was the recruit's older sister. He's playing ball and mama's raising two grandchildren, his sister's kids. Mama's tired and doesn't want to raise another set of kids. So we make the calls and arrange for the daughter to go to rehab, then set her up with a job when she's done. Fast track her to a job at a private business, nothing suspicious. Now mama can enjoy her son playing and the daughter is back on her feet. And when it came time to sign, we made sure she saw something [cash], but I promise you that meant more than just money."</p>
    <p>The most common non-cash gifts to recruits are cars. In every major city inside the Southeastern Conference's footprint is a tangle of auto dealerships with varying ties to particular schools.</p>


    <p>"There are jokes about kids getting cars, but that's actually pretty easy. We all have dealerships all over. You practically have to nowadays, anyway, just for the coaches. Think about it. Most schools, all the football, basketball, and baseball coaches and their wives are getting some kind of vehicle for free as part of their contract. Then they're turning them in every three years or so. That's a fleet right there. You need a lot of guys with dealerships, and you need them in different towns. Then getting a clean title on a member of the family is pretty easy."</p>
    <p>Whatever the minimum of necessary paperwork to absolve a player of improper benefits received is, it's not a problem. A title for a moderately priced SUV can be created in a relative's name, as can a receipt of sale for a reasonable price.</p>
    <p>"Hey, how'd he get that ride? His uncle bought it. How did his uncle buy it? Paid cash. Paid cash, how'd he do that? Shit, we don't know, but here's the receipt where he paid cash, and now y'all ain't got shit. Go tell the NCAA you think we're cheating because this kid's uncle bought him a used Tahoe in cash, you racist."</p>
    <p>Resources, assistance, paperwork, and even a subpar explanation mean most needs can be taken care of.</p>
    <p>"One time grandpa needed his tractor fixed. He and grandma were the primary care-givers of this kid out in a rural area. Well, they aren't going to turn down the money, and they didn't, but what they needed was a tractor to get fixed. But we couldn't take this tractor to get fixed just anywhere, because the guy who does that locally works for a business that's owned by a [rival school] fan."</p>
    <p>Why not just buy a new tractor?</p>
    <p>"Because that would be like a Lamborghini showing up in their driveway. See, you don't know how much a tractor costs. So we've got to get this tractor to a repair guy who we're comfortable enough calling up and saying, 'Hey, fix this. He's good for it. We're taking care of it.' The tractor gets fixed. Now you try and prove we fixed that tractor."</p>
    <p>What about a receipt?</p>
    <p>"You're a reporter. You can't demand a receipt from a private business. Besides, did you know that repair guy owed that farmer a favor? He did it for half the normal cost and the guy paid him in cash. You're not the IRS, anyway."</p>
    <p>And the NCAA?</p>
    <p>"He's a farmer. He got paid extra on a side job or made extra taking something to market. Paid for it that way. Whatever."</p>
    <p>Still, why not limit the interaction to simply providing the money for the repair? Why get so involved when it only increases potential complications or chances of exposure?</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>"Because of the competition. If we're after a guy, what are the chances four more schools in the SEC aren't after him too? What you want more than anything else is the ability to sit down with that decision-maker, grandma or mama or the uncle, right before the time comes and say, 'Hey, we know that old so-and-so from [rival school] has come to see you. That's fine. But we know you know who's been here since the beginning and who's been taking care of you.' You want them to believe that you'll take care of them the best in the future, too."</p>
    <p>Remember, your job as a bag man isn't to hide the benefit. It's to hide the proof. In a region as passionate about college football as the American South, there's no real moral outrage when new cars or clothes or jobs for relatives appear.</p>
    <p>"We can only get away with whatever's considered reasonable by the majority of the folks in our society. That's why it's different in the SEC. Maybe that's why we're able to be more active in what we do. Because no one ever looks at the car or the jewelry and says, 'How did you get that, poor football player?' They say, 'How did they get you that and not get caught, poor football player?'"</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>VII. You will know your enemy.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>Rural Southerners make a habit of knowing each other's business. Chances are you'll become aware of and -- believe it or not -- friends with bag men for rivals schools. Not that there's such a concept of friends in love or war.</p>
    <p>"It's a small group. If you grow up in the state, you end up knowing folks. It's really that simple. But that won't stop them from trying to bury your ass when it gets down to it. A few years back, we were fighting hard for a kid in their backyard. We went for a full year with the family, thought we had it wrapped up. Still thought we had it done the night before Signing Day. He liked our coaches. But the family keeps dragging it and dragging it. Late that night I get a call, and it's the player on the phone, the kid himself. You could tell he was nervous. He said, &lsquo;Mr. [name], I talked to my mama, and we decided that $70,000 and we're going with you, if you can promise us $70,000 tonight.' I knew right away we were being recorded, and I knew the asshole down there who had set it up. I knew him personally. They had him. That part was done. But they wanted to get someone on tape to try and turn it over to the NCAA. So I said, 'Well gosh [player name], we'd love to see you here next season, but we just don't do that kind of thing.' Then I hung up."</p>
    <p>The bag men associated with certain schools pay potential signees one-time bonus payments not to visit a rival school that's offered a scholarship. The going rate is stated to be $2,500. This has become a popular tactic in recent years, as the recruiting process has become more publicized.</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>"You can have a rival coach who is considered a great recruiter, and he might say, 'We feel great about this kid, if we can just get him on campus.' Well, what if you can't even get him to show up? How great a recruiter are you now?"</p>
    <p>This tactic is not universally employed. Some coaches encourage players to visit other campuses to recruit other players. Some like for everyone to know how many other schools have offered a player before he makes his choice, making it look like the chosen school beat an even longer list of rivals. Regardless, it's a shining example of how influential shadow boosters are in the recruiting process and how crucial they are to the success of a coach's reputation as a good recruiter.</p>
    <p>It's also how lame duck coaching staffs are created. If a majority of bag men want a particular coach out and an A.D. or president won't make a move, they'll just dry up funds.</p>
    <p>"The coach won't know exactly when we decide to make that happen, but they've got a good idea. Then we get to see just how damn good a recruiter he really is. I know one of our guys once stopped putting in big bucks, way more than what I do, just because a head coach cussed too much on the team plane. [The coach] was losing anyway, but because he took the Lord's name in vain, that guy was offended by his morality and stopped illegally paying college football players."</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>VIII. Small, simple and frequent.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>There's little use for an actual bag, especially once an athlete is signed and on campus. Rather than dole out large sums of money, the bag man usually prefers to hand over frequent payments of $200 to $500. It prevents the player from overspending, losing the money or getting robbed, and ...</p>
    <p>"I don't like to run around with thousands in cash on my person, either. This isn't 'Scarface.'"</p>
    <p>Think of how quickly the average student blows through a student loan check. The increased frequency of the meets help foster a better relationship, as each bag man is assigned or volunteers for particular players. The more often the meetings, the more casual and less clandestine they can become, but the level of maintenance can be stressful. This also means that bag men willing to either live in or near the university town are highly valued.</p>
    <p>This usually isn't a problem, as most college towns are considered desirable places to raise families and operate businesses.</p>
    <p>"I don't know how much some of the kids are getting. I just handle my guys. Obviously I know it's happening, but I can't tell you when or where or how much or how often. I just handle my guys."</p>
  </div>
  <div><span> <h3>IX. Just say no to bounties and bonuses.</h3></span></div>
  <div>
    <p>"I had this one kid, great player, good guy. Never got in trouble, but never did much on the field. But he's calling me all the time. 'Hey, the sunroof in my car is leaking,' he says, so I tell him to come meet me. $150. Two days later it's: 'Hey, I'm going out this weekend with a girl, can you help me?' $200. Next week after that he's got $300 in parking tickets. So one day I go to meet him to give him money and I ask, "Hey man, aren't you a business major? Have y'all learned what ROI means yet? It means return on investment, and at this rate I'm going to need to start seeing some touchdowns.'"</p>
    <div>

    </div>

    <p>This is a newer wrinkle for the bag man. As a fan, the temptation might be to reward a player who's putting up great numbers, just as you might want to withhold from one who's thought to be showing poor effort. But as a businessperson, that's poor management. The 1980s Miami Hurricanes are in many ways a what-not-to-do guide for shadow boosters, but it was the system of incentives and bounties favored by 2000s Miami booster Nevin Shapiro that's shown the foolishness of incentives.</p>
    <p>Handing out $100 bills for interceptions or sacks used to seem like the bag man's top responsibility, but they've learned. Performance-based rewards require some kind of record-keeping, which is the first red light. The second is a potential for competition among players that could bleed over into animosity or somehow affect on-field efficiency.</p>
    <p>"I read the stuff Oklahoma State was accused of. The reason I don't believe a lot of it is because how stupid they come off. When they said players were getting cash envelopes handed out in the locker room after the game like it was Gatorade, I thought, 'surely this is a joke.' And if I was a player, stopped getting money because I was hurt or buried on the depth chart or was maybe playing through an injury you didn't know about, I'd go to the media, too."</p>

    <p>College majors like Exercise Science and General Education have long been assailed by critics as crip-course degrees, but shadow boosters see them as a vital way to perpetuate the cycle. If a player finishes out his eligibility and has no feasible future in the pros, he might return home and become a nearby high school coach. It doesn't matter if it's junior high or seven-on-seven camps; each means a new brand ambassador for the program.</p>
    <p>"You win the gym teachers, and you can go a long way. That's why all those basket-weaving degrees are so important, because we need 'em on both ends. You need 'em to keep the kids qualified, and you need 'em to produce guys who can go back and coach and teach and help us."</p>
    <p>It doesn't hurt that the system produces agents who often become the most powerful male influence in a young athlete's life. And there is, of course, a fiscal incentive for the ex-athlete to help steer future players in the same direction he went. The bag man doesn't expect any coach to push 100 percent of his Division I-worthy talent to any one particular place, let alone his alma mater, but rather pick spots for the big ones.</p>
    <p>"Kids are going to grow up liking teams for one reason or another, but when it comes time to start seriously talking to them, you need as many folks as you can get. Mama wins almost every time. Mama's most important. But you get coaches with ties to the school, then you get one person who has all those kids' attention."</p>

    </div><br><p>This system and the men operating it want you to know that they don't succeed so often and raise the stakes so fearlessly because they're that good. It's because so many people care so much. There might not be a cultural mandate, but describing an October Saturday in the South as a culture accepting of this behavior would be a raging understatement.</p>

    <p>"I'm not Nevin Shapiro. I'm not telling these kids to give another player a concussion. I'm not paying for abortions. It's 2014. Who's left to tell that would get angry? Who's left that would object to seeing these kids getting some money?"</p>
    <p>If you believe any of this happens with the frequency and level of organization described, you might assume that such practices surely couldn't go entirely unnoticed, that surely someone not involved in a conspiracy to illegally funnel money to college-aged athletes would expose the plot. It's happened before, after all.</p>
    <p>"It happens, yeah, but now we start to ask, &lsquo;Who would do that?' You try your damnedest to take care of everyone involved for a long as you can. Look at where we live. Look at how much everyone cares. Think about how much of a pariah any one of us would become if we spoke out, especially with no real evidence.</p>
    <p>"I look at this as an investment. When you ask me why I do this ... let me ask you something. Who's your favorite sports team? Most favorite. Who do you live and die with? What if I told you that if you gave me $10,000 right now I could guarantee you they'd be better? That if they were usually bad that they'd have a winning season? Or if they were just a game shy of going to a championship that they'd get there next season?"</p>
    <p>"Hey, man," he calls to the bartender.</p>
    <p>"If I told you right now the [team] would win the SEC this fall and go to the Playoff, but only if you gave me 10 grand, would you do it?"</p>
    <p>"Shit, man ... will you take a check?," the bartender asks. "But if you could really do that, I'd probably get the cash together in a day or two."</p>
