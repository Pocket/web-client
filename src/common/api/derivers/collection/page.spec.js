  intro:
    'October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, which deserves more than a calendar notification to update your passwords. This year, it comes at a time when technology companies play an increasingly prominent part of our lives—and not always for the better. \n\nIn this collection of articles and tools, I want to dwell on the complexities and inequalities of our hyper-connected world. It can be thorny out there, but it’s more important than ever to pay attention, investigate, and fight back where we can. So… let’s dig in! --*Alex Argüelles (Alex K.)*',

  intro:
    'A few years ago I started to feel like journalism just wasn’t working the way it was supposed to—it was hard to know how to be useful in an age of outrage and division. That led me to write [a book](https://link.slate.com/click/25011894.629/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwLzE5ODIxMjg1NjkvP3RhZz1zbGF0bWFnYS0yMCZzaWQ9NWNmOTkxYTkzZjkyYTQ1MjA4OTI0ZDg4JnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9jb250ZW50PVNsYXRlUGx1c0RpZ2VzdCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249dHJhZmZpYw/5cf991a93f92a45208924d88Bb40fb395) about how people get out of really intractable conflict… which then turned into an opportunity to host *How To!*. \n\nI love the way the show solves problems, rather than just lamenting them. And I love the way it brings the listener right into the studio with the journalist and the experts, so we can all just huddle up and try to figure it out. It’s a show that is low in ego and high in curiosity, which seems well-suited to this moment in time.\n\nOur latest episode was sparked by an email we got from a listener in the UK. Rob is a father of two children who are “90 percent wonderful and 10 percent absolute terrors.” At the end of the day all they want to do is play, but Rob is absolutely exhausted from a busy work day. He’s tried taking naps, but it usually just makes him more tired. So we dug into the latest sleep science and brought on Sara Mednick, author of *[Take a Nap! Change Your Life](https://www.amazon.com/Take-Nap-Change-Your-Life/dp/0761142908/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)* to try and help. Along the way, Sara shared some pretty fantastic resources to make napping work the way you want it to. And ultimately, feel better, more rested, and like a more active part of your own life. I’m excited to share some of the highlights from our chat, and hope you come away from this collection primed for a sweet 26-minute snooze.   --*Amanda Ripley*',
